tc.research_text.InfusedGoldGTNH=[AM] Infuse Gold with magic.
tc.research_page.InfusedGoldGTNH.1=You found a way to fuse gold and thaumium to create a new metal INFUSED GOLD
tc.research_category.BLOODMAGIC=Blood Magic
tc.research_name.BLOODALTAR=Blood Altar
tc.research_text.BLOODALTAR=[BM] Paying the highest price.
tc.research_page.BLOODALTAR.1=In your travels, you have found yourself facing many kinds of strange beings, but there are few who can bring forth this unsettling feel, this immense doubt.<BR><BR>The vision is still as clear as it was at that moment, when you first laid eyes upon a Blood Mage. These individuals, hardly referred to as people, seemed to worship the energies and forces that spilled out from pain and suffering. Where a thaumaturge seeks control, a mage in red seeks entropy, the destruction of the natural to build the unnatural. Yet, the rare result of their success is a true wonder of magic.
tc.research_page.BLOODALTAR.2=Dark magic is nothing new to you, or most mages who have ever dabbled in thaumaturgy, but these... individuals possessed something more than simple madness. In fact, they seemed to lack it altogether.<BR><BR>This last time, the sight of the Blood Mage was accompanied by an altar, made of stone and blood, where the victim's sacrifices became the owner's power. Sometimes, the victim was a monster or an animal, but the mage also harmed themselves whenever there was no other sacrifice to make. You would have been next in the chopping block, but whoever they were recognized your abilities and showed you the rituals of their art, the ways of Blood Magic.
tc.research_page.BLOODALTAR.3=Through it all, there was a slight emptiness in their eyes, something that warned you to stay away, yet dragged in your endless curiosity... only a mad person would walk this path.<BR><BR>Regardless of that, you have decided to go forth. You have seen the power, and you will not retreat from it, nor will you ignore its existence. The Thaumonomicon speaks to you in tongues you barely understand, at times, but you have a feeling that it's all going to be magnificent.
tc.research_page.BLOODALTAR.4=This altar serves as the first reservoir for your sacrifices, although the first drops of blood you gave it seemed to disappear into nothing. It can hold a maximum of 10,000 Life Essence (LP), but it has a 1,000 LP buffer that needs to be satisfied before it can be used for crafting.<BR><BR>According to what you've seen, this single altar can be expanded by building a structure around it, in a similar way to a Beacon, with 6 tiers of construction available. The structure stretches below, like a pyramid, with specific blocks that might or might not improve the Blood Altar. The runes written on some of them looked eerie, though.
tc.research_name.LIFEINFUSER=Life Infuser
tc.research_text.LIFEINFUSER=[BA] Transfer your Life Essence
tc.research_page.LIFEINFUSER.1=Slowly, you begin to understand the extent of this bloody conjecture. You have found a way to reconstruct physical objects, such as tools, by imbuing them with the energy of life you have been gathering, a Life Infuser.<BR><BR>It takes in life essence, and gradually repairs a tool using 500 LE per damage point repaired. Once an orb is inserted into the Life Essence Materializer, it will suck out LP from the orb's owner converting it to Life Essence which can then be pumped out, at a 3:2 ratio of LP:LE
tc.research_page.LIFEINFUSER.2=Unfortunately, your early prototypes crumbled to pieces when trying to channel the essence at a strong enough rate. It appears you will need better building blocks for this device, something beyond what the basic Altar can create, or its first tier upgrade. Until then, you risk destroying your tools, or yourself, instead of repairing them.
tc.research_name.SOULCOMPACTER=Soul Compacter
tc.research_text.SOULCOMPACTER=[BA] Packing your Ritual
tc.research_page.SOULCOMPACTER=The extremely powerful Soul Compacter: Put underneath a master ritual stone with a ritual or underneath an altar. Right click it with an orb to compact the whole thing into one block! WARNING: May use a bit more LP than you'd think!
tc.research_name.SACRIFICIALKNIFE=Sacrificial Knife
tc.research_text.SACRIFICIALKNIFE=[BM] Ouch! that hurts.
tc.research_page.SACRIFICIALKNIFE.1=Simply using drops of blood to feed the Altar did not seem to get you anywhere. To generate the LP you need through sacrifice, it would be best to create a tool, enchanted for the job. The Sacrificial Knife is such a tool, a way to properly generate LP in the Blood Altar.<BR><BR>The Sacrificial Knife is used as a self-sacrifice method, allowing the user to convert their health points into usable Life Essence. To take health from other creatures in return for LP, sacrifice methods such as the Dagger of Sacrifice must be used.
tc.research_page.SACRIFICIALKNIFE.2=If the user of the knife is a Vampire, their blood will be drained rather than their health, but a human will have to lose and regain health to keep the Altar fed. Whichever form of regeneration you might have acquired, this is the time to use, you repeat to yourself. Shudders of anxiety shake your core, to think how many times you will have to stab and slice your skin to continue...<BR><BR>Within your recollections, you remember seeing novice mages going through this process, but the veterans seemed to have other ways. Somehow, you must discover them.
tc.research_name.ALCHEMICCHEMSTRYSET=Alchemic Chemistry Set
tc.research_text.ALCHEMICCHEMSTRYSET=[BM] Blub, blub.....OH
tc.research_page.ALCHEMICCHEMSTRYSET.1=It was not a mirage, nor a false memory. The Blood Mages from your past travels worked with flasks and vials, as if they were alchemists, but they did not work on a regular brewing stand. Instead, they operated on this.<BR><BR>The Alchemic Chemistry Set is the foundation of another branch of Blood Magic, a place to brew strange, new potions and concotions, sure to be used in other crafting attempts. Along with many other inputs, you will need LP to actually work with this block.
tc.research_page.ALCHEMICCHEMSTRYSET.2=You remember seeing this stand being put together with some strange, dark plates. You believe that the lone Altar you have built is good enough to imbue these plates with enough energy to sustain your soon-to-be alchemical future. Perhaps it will ease the stinging, although that has been softening over the days by itself.<BR><BR>The repertoire of a Blood Mage involves some strange substances, vaguely reminding you of a witch's brewing. Looking at this construct, you believe this is where those are made.
tc.research_name.AMORPHICCATALYST=Amorphic Catalyst
tc.research_text.AMORPHICCATALYST=[BA] Mixed Catalyst
tc.research_page.AMORPHICCATALYST=Take a Reinforced Slate and infuse it with all magical ingredients you can make. Now you have a very powerful catalyst.
tc.research_name.BIDIAMONDBLOCK=Blood Infused Diamond Block
tc.research_text.BIDIAMONDBLOCK=[BA] A Blood Diamond Block
tc.research_page.BIDIAMONDBLOCK=The Blood Infused Diamond Block is made out of 9 Blood Diamonds in the Infusion Process. It is requiered for the Blood Infused Diamond Tools
tc.research_name.DIVINATIONSIGIL=Divination Sigil
tc.research_text.DIVINATIONSIGIL=[BM] How much Essence do you have?
tc.research_page.DIVINATIONSIGIL.1=You can see nothing, you are blind to the truth. This is what you think, when you look at the Blood Altar and see nothing but the essential remains of your work. As a mage, you stand in the exact same spot as you did when you first saw a node with the naked eye, in wonder at the mysterious figure in front of your incapable sight.<BR><BR>To overcome this obstacle, and to better understand the reality that you had found yourself facing, you built a Thaumometer. Here, you will have to gain a new kind of vision as well, in order to proceed onwards.
tc.research_page.DIVINATIONSIGIL.2=You have found a special kind of lens to see through the Altar's mysteries. This lens takes the form of a Sigil, the Divination Sigil, which is used to check important details of both the Blood Altar and the player's network.<BR><BR>While holding the Divination Sigil, there are two possible uses that you can choose from. When aiming at a Blood Altar and right clicking, a chat printout will display the total essence stored within the altar, the current tier, and its maximum capacity. When right clicking anywhere else, a chat printout will display the total essence stored within the player's personal network.
tc.research_name.SPEEDRUNE=Speed Rune
tc.research_text.SPEEDRUNE=[BM] How fast is your Altar?
tc.research_page.SPEEDRUNE.1=The capacity of the Blood Altar seems to directly depend on the structure built around it, and so do your possibilities as a Blood Mage. You have seen some of these structures in the past, put together with black stones similar to those used in Infusion.<BR><BR>You have also, however, seen strange inscriptions on some of those stones, symbols that seemed to give some kind of meaning to the ritualistic pyramid where the Altar stood. As you attempted to engrave markings into this stone, you too have realized what it all means.
tc.research_page.SPEEDRUNE.2=The first upgrade is nothing more than a 3x3 square under the Altar. You can use simple blocks, the so called Blank Runes, but it you have managed to improve upon them through trial and error, mixing the correct items and incantations through Infusion.<BR><BR>The first success, surely of many, that you have found yourself facing is the Speed Rune, which accelerates the processing speed of the Altar by 25%, and can replace any other Rune in the structure. The higher the tier, the more Runes you can fit in the structure.
tc.research_name.IMPERFECTRITUALSTONE=Imperfect Ritual Stone
tc.research_text.IMPERFECTRITUALSTONE=[BM] Basic but oho.
tc.research_page.IMPERFECTRITUALSTONE.1=Imperfect Ritual Stone is a block from Blood Magic used in the construction of Rituals. The Imperfect Ritual Stone is used in weaker rituals, such as the Water Ritual. <BR>A weak ritual is simple but can be useful. Each is created by placing a specific block on top of an Imperfect Ritual Stone, then activated by Right-clicking the Stone. Each cost 5,000 Life Essence.
tc.research_page.IMPERFECTRITUALSTONE.2=1. Water source block creates a thunderstorm.<BR>2. Block of coal summons a strong zombie.<BR>3. Lapis lazuli block makes it night time.<BR>4. Bedrock above grants Resistance II for 1 minute.
tc.research_name.RITUALSTONE=Ritual Stone
tc.research_text.RITUALSTONE=[BM] Rituals
tc.research_page.RITUALSTONE=The Ritual Stone is a block added by Blood Magic that is used to create various rituals, such as the Ritual of Binding. The Ritual Stones can be automatically placed and painted by the Ritual Diviner, or they can be manually placed and painted with the various Elemental Inks, such as the Elemental Inscription Tool: Air. The Ritual Stone is also used in the creation of the Master Ritual Stone.
tc.research_name.SPELLTABLE=Spell Table
tc.research_text.SPELLTABLE=[BM] Abrakadabra.....
tc.research_page.SPELLTABLE=The Spell Table is a block added by Blood Magic that is used as a focus for the Basic Spell System. It is used in conjunction with a Unbound Crystal and a Blood Altar. After crafting a Spell Table, place it next to a Blood Altar. After that, one must place a skull on the Spell table to determine what type of effect will ensue when casting the spell. A Skeleton Skull denotes an Offensive-Ranged spell, Wither Skull is Offensive-Melee, Zombie Head allows for Defensive Spells, and the Creeper Head is for Environmental spells. Once one has chosen what type of spell one wants, the player can place several items in the adjacent Blood Altar to denote exactly what spell one wants to cast.
tc.research_name.MASTERRITUALSTONE=Master Ritual Stone
tc.research_text.MASTERRITUALSTONE=[BM] Let's start some Rituals
tc.research_page.MASTERRITUALSTONE=The Master Ritual Stone is a block added by Blood Magic. The Master Ritual Stone is used in the creation of all rituals except for the weak rituals, such as the Water Ritual. The Master Ritual Stone is the center of each ritual as it is used to activate them. Sending a redstone signal into a Master Ritual Stone will cause the ritual to stop functioning. Removing this redstone signal will allow the ritual to continue running without it requiring a restart with an activation crystal.
tc.research_name.WATERSIGIL=Water Sigil
tc.research_text.WATERSIGIL=[BM] Infinite water, anyone?
tc.research_page.WATERSIGIL=By sacrificing mortal energy, you can reconstruct the unnatural. When tampering with sigils, you found water dripping endlessly from a single bucket. That is the Water Sigil, an alternative to said water buckets, allowing for the creation of water source blocks at the cost of 200 LP per source block.<BR><BR>This essence will be drawn from the network of whoever the sigil is bound to. As you work with this Sigil, you understand it has further potential, but only if combined with something else...
tc.research_name.LAVASIGIL=Lava Sigil
tc.research_text.LAVASIGIL=[BM] Contact with Liquid is highly uncommon
tc.research_page.LAVASIGIL=By sacrificing mortal energy, you can reconstruct the unnatural. Your newfound lack of carefulness almost cost you a hand, as the lava bucket you so carefully brought home began to spill out, endlessly pouring the hot fluid until you stopped feeding it energy. A Sigil related to fire that you had been preparing suddenly took on a new role.<BR><BR>This Lava Sigil allows for the creation of lava source blocks at the cost of 2,000 LP per source block, from your network. You feel as if this can make you more resistant to fire, somehow...
tc.research_name.EMPTYCORE=Empty Core
tc.research_text.EMPTYCORE=[BM] All you need is a core
tc.research_page.EMPTYCORE=You have sought to create building blocks for more advanced magic, to grasp at the true potential of this field. The Slates have proven useful, but they can only accept LP and little else.<BR><BR>Instead, an Empty Core must be used to contain other kinds of magical artifacts, with the use of an alchemical Catalyst. Without said catalyst, the new materials and energies you have found yourself embracing will never mix together. From here, it should be easy to put together new, more complex Cores.
tc.research_name.BMLAVACRYSTAL=Lava Crystal
tc.research_text.BMLAVACRYSTAL=[BM] TC Lava Crystal, Warded Glass...
tc.research_page.BMLAVACRYSTAL=The power from within is now the power to fuel the world. By infusing an Empty Core with an assortment of specific items, you have built the Lava Crystal, a replacement fuel source in furnaces and engines.<BR><BR>Rather than losing durability, the crystal drains 25 Life Essence from your network per operation. In order to use the Lava Crystal, it must first be bound to you. To do this, right click while holding the crystal. Once bound, it will begin to function as a fuel source.
tc.research_name.RUNESACRIFICE=Rune of Sacrifice
tc.research_text.RUNESACRIFICE=[BM] Very bloody
tc.research_page.RUNESACRIFICE=Through careful experimentation and planning, you have managed to make more out of every creature you sacrifice to the altar. With the Rune of Sacrifice, the Altar will have the total amount of LP gained by sacrificing mobs increased by 12%, with the Dagger of Sacrifice, for each rune that you add into the Altar's structure.<BR><BR>You are as of yet unsure if you are drawing more blood from your enemies, but their deaths have become meaningless at this point. Who would care about these creatures?
tc.research_name.RUNESELFSACRIFICE=Rune of Self Sacrifice
tc.research_text.RUNESELFSACRIFICE=[BM] Even more bloody
tc.research_page.RUNESELFSACRIFICE=Ever since you began in this bloody journey, you have felt your personal sacrifices hurting you less and less, sapping away very little if any of your vigor. Through it, you have discovered the correct rune to boost the efficiency of those sacrifices, the Rune of Sacrifice. This block will increase the total amount of LP gained by using a Sacrificial Dagger by 12%, for each rune that you add into the Altar's structure.<BR><BR>You can tell the Altar is filling faster, but it seems to give you no joy.
tc.research_name.AIRSIGIL=Air Sigil
tc.research_text.AIRSIGIL=[BM] Fly like a bird but don't look down.
tc.research_page.AIRSIGIL=Through this journey, you have learned that carefulness often delays progress. You were afraid of using this power on yourself, but these fears are now gone, replaced by a strange rush of excitement and a hint of queasiness. Today, you have learned how to fly.<BR><BR>Using this Air Sigil, you are granted access to a basic method of flight, at the cost of LP. Upon right clicking with the Air Sigil, you can launch yourself in the direction you are facing at the cost of 50 LP per click.  However, you are still vulnerable to fall damage without a form of protection.
tc.research_name.FASTERMINING=Sigil of Faster Mining
tc.research_text.FASTERMINING=[BM] Haste II and you?
tc.research_page.FASTERMINING=How strange. When you try to apply Life Essence back to yourself, it does more than regenerate your body, it facilitates and accelerates your actions. The Sigil of the Fast Miner, as an example, takes advantage of this boost by granting the user Haste II at the cost of Life Essence (LP).<BR><BR>Upon activating the Sigil of the Fast Miner, 100 LP will be consumed from your network to grant the buff, and once again every 10 seconds. Your mining speed will be greatly accelerated while the Sigil is active.
tc.research_name.GREENGROW=Sigil of the Green Grow
tc.research_text.GREENGROW=[BM] Who needs a green thumb?
tc.research_page.GREENGROW=With a magical sleight of hand, the essence of living can grow any living matter. After focusing your efforts into plants, you have created the Sigil of the Green Grove.<BR><BR>When activated, the Sigil will speed the growth of all nearby plants, by applying additional growth ticks to all plants within a six block radius of the caster. This effect will consume 150 LP every five seconds. Right clicking on a plant that accepts Bone Meal will cause its growth effect to be activated on that plant, consuming 150 LP per usage.
tc.research_name.VOIDSIGIL=Void Sigil
tc.research_text.VOIDSIGIL=[BM] Better than a swiffer!
tc.research_page.VOIDSIGIL=Creation and destruction, the cycle of all life. Upon mastering the Water Sigil, you realized that you had no good way of removing the water you created. As a mage dedicated to an art that begins with destruction, this is unacceptable.<BR><BR>Looking for a tool of reversal, you decided to name it the Void Sigil, used to remove source blocks of liquid at a small LP cost. Once bound to you, right clicking any placed liquid source block will cause it to disappear, at the cost of 50 LP, removing that source block from existence. Good riddance.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFSWIMMING=Sigil of Swimming
tc.research_text.SIGILOFSWIMMING=[BA] Like a fish
tc.research_page.SIGILOFSWIMMING=There is power beyond improving what your fragile body can already do. By reinfusing your Life Essence, with the use of Blood Magic, you have found yourself transcending your own limitations.<BR><BR>The Sigil of Swimming, as you have hastily named it, allows you to move faster, break faster, and breathe underwater, costing 100 LP every 10 seconds. This is an exhilarating sensation, of the kind you thought impossible. How can your body do this?
tc.research_name.BLOODLETTERSPACK=Blood Letters Pack
tc.research_text.BLOODLETTERSPACK=[BM] This pack really chaffs...
tc.research_page.BLOODLETTERSPACK.1=The repetition of losing and regaining health, all to feed the Altar, has been wearing out your patience more than your pain tolerance. Your fingers are very useful for practicing magic, and as such you have found a different way to undergo self-sacrifice, using a Thaumium Chestplate to magically siphon blood from your veins.<BR><BR>The spikes on the inside are daunting to look at, but you have managed to put it on yourself, with less discomfort than you expected when you first looked at the finished product, which you named after letting it take your blood, for the sake of magic.
tc.research_page.BLOODLETTERSPACK.2=The Blood Letter's Pack is a piece of armor that can automate the acquiral of LP from your own life force. Wearing the armor does one heart of damage a second, and fills 100 LP per heart lost. It will not reduce your health below 5 hearts, in your attempts to preserve yourself.<BR><BR>The armor stores up to 10000 LP as built by default, and it can be used to store LP while away from your main reservoir of LP. Using a filled Pack on the Altar will transfer stored LP into the Altar's buffer tank. With a handy source of Regeneration, you can keep this up endlessly.
tc.research_name.IMBUEARMOR=Life Imbue Armor
tc.research_text.IMBUEARMOR=[BM] Life for blood
tc.research_page.IMBUEARMOR=The Life Imbued Armor is a powerful armor able to store Life Essence and utilize it to protect the wearer. Wearing this full set of armor will randomly heal you completely for the cost of LE inside the armor. Can be refilled in the Life Infuser.
tc.research_name.WEAKORB=Weak Orb
tc.research_text.WEAKORB=[BM] Orb transformation Tier I
tc.research_page.WEAKORB.1=A Blood Mage, by default, is forcefully kept near their Altar to practice magic. Even though liquid essence can be transported, it cannot fuel most magical items simply by pouring it, or burning it in some way.<BR><BR>This, however, is not an impediment to the Blood Mages you have seen working in the field, as they have accomplished simple tasks with the energy from the essence, regardless of their position. There must be a way to store and link this inner energy, so that you can carry the magic with you.
tc.research_page.WEAKORB.2=This construct is called a Blood Orb by most mages, and it can store a limited amount of LP to be used by an assortment of magical devices. The materials used in the craft can make higher tier, or lower tier Orbs, but each one has to be infused with enough LP to be operational, so a beginner mage such as yourself can only create the first tier one, the Weak Blood Orb.<BR><BR>These items can also be used for crafting other items, and are never consumed.
tc.research_name.APPRENTICEORB=Apprentice Orb
tc.research_text.APPRENTICEORB=[BM] Orb transformation Tier II
tc.research_page.APPRENTICEORB.1=After successfully upgrading the tier of your Blood Altar, you can also upgrade your Blood Orb to a new level. The amount of storage you have access to is quite limiting, so this improvement is a sigh of relief, as is the potential of the orb when used to craft other items, or when delving in alchemy. Surely, now, you can invest in ways to ease up on the self-sacrifices you were forced to do so far, right?<BR><BR>The last time you asked a Blood Mage about the topic, they told you that you'll get used to it, but that's surely nonsense. They must have some kind of secret that they're hiding!
tc.research_page.APPRENTICEORB.2=This tier 2 Blood Orb can hold 25,000 LP, 5 times more than the previous version. With this storage amount, you should be able to use more demanding Sigils than before, at least for a limited time. The upgrade also allows for more possible crafts and alchemic recipes, a benefit that will happen from now on with each new Blood Orb.<BR><BR>You make a hasty note to remind yourself that the required orb for each recipe is a very important detail that should not be missed.
tc.research_name.MAGICANORB=Magician's Orb
tc.research_text.MAGICANORB=[BM] Orb transformation Tier III
tc.research_page.MAGICANORB.1=You look back at your Altar, immensely bigger and more intricate than it was before, more similar to those you have seen used by your mentors. You envision another upgrade to your Blood Orb, even if just to avoid using up vital Rune spots to increase its storage amount.<BR><BR>Despite having access to a lot more of them, you find it unacceptable to use the available spots in such a rudimentary fashion. It's hard to explain, but the structure you have built weighs on your mind in some distant, faded out way.
tc.research_page.MAGICANORB.2=The storage amount of the tier 3 Orb is 150,000, 6 times higher than the tier 2 one. It's a hefty battery, certainly, but you can already foresee the difficulty in filling it up if you don't optimize the LP earnings of your Blood Altar. Specific Runes should help for this task, as should the new recipes that are unlocked with this tier 3 orb and the corresponding Imbued Slates.
tc.research_name.MASTERORB=Master Orb
tc.research_text.MASTERORB=[BM] Orb transformation Tier IV
tc.research_page.MASTERORB=It is time for this, once again. Stepping past the tier 3 Altar, it is possible to improve your Blood Orb once more, with the new version storing 1,000,000 LP, 6 times more than the previous one.<BR><BR>It should be easy to fill this up, you think to yourself, otherwise you would be in considerable trouble to face whatever this new tier of Blood Magic brings to the table.
tc.research_name.ARCHMAGEORB=Archmage's Orb
tc.research_text.ARCHMAGEORB=[BM] Orb transformation Tier V
tc.research_page.ARCHMAGEORB.1=Something calls out to you, not from a distance, but from within. Once you saw the scribings on your Altar's blocks come to life, once again in this new structure, there was a sudden drive to put together the new Blood Orb that you had certainly earned the right to create.<BR><BR>The materials have gotten more expensive over time, but your dwindling will to continue flipped on its head and now shoves you towards the goal at hand. It's difficult to understand why this is happening, but there's something in your blind spot that you cannot yet perceive, but you know is there.
tc.research_page.ARCHMAGEORB.2=This upgrade is the biggest yet, with the tier 5 Blood Orb holding an impressive 10,000,000 LP at max capacity, more enough for any Sigil you would like to use. Only the most expensive, most powerful magic effects could empty this orb in a reasonable amount of time... ones you might not have discovered yet.<BR><BR>The possibilities push you here and there, even if you seem to exhaust the possibilities of magic you find around you. There is more to all of this, deeper within the very fabric of the matter, yet you don't see a way to reach beyond what the inner eye can see. There must be something more, somewhere...
tc.research_name.TRANSCENDENTORB=Transcendent Orb
tc.research_text.TRANSCENDENTORB=[BM] Orb transformation Tier VI
tc.research_page.TRANSCENDENTORB.1=This is where you stand, at the top of all worlds. The limits you were explained have been shattered to pieces and, out of the shards, a new you arrived, beaming with satisfaction and victory. To sit at the frontier of knowledge, and step into the unknown, is to call out to the gods and only hear your own voice in response.<BR><BR>For the master of all crafts, technological and magical, a new future dawns on the horizon, a sight that everyone else is blind to. What they look at, they will never see, until you flash it in front of their eyes with a powerful lightning.
tc.research_page.TRANSCENDENTORB.2=Slayer of demons, this tier 6 Blood Orb is your reward, holding as much as 30,000,000 LP before any Rune upgrades. Any and all sources of LP are now at your disposal, and your Sigil costs will disappear into the abyss.<BR><BR>The whole world is in the palm of your hand, and you only have to squeeze it shut into a fist. It will not shatter, it will only grow, transform into something bigger that is yours to take. The future is uncertain, but success is guaranteed.<BR><BR>If there is something out there that requires a truly powerful Blood Magic component, you are sure that you can produce it now. The only question is when.
tc.research_name.TRANSPARENTORB=Transparent Orb
tc.research_text.TRANSPARENTORB=[BM] How much Life Points are in your Orb?
tc.research_page.TRANSPARENTORB=Transparent Orb: Did you ever want to know how much Liefe Essence is in your Blood Orb? Now you can. Dynamic measuring of Liefe Points! Magical.
tc.research_name.EMPTYSOCKET=Empty Socket
tc.research_text.EMPTYSOCKET=[BM] Hmm, this does not seem to work...
tc.research_page.EMPTYSOCKET=The Empty Socket is a block added by Blood Magic that is used in the creation of the Filled Socket. The Empty Socket is the first step in creating Bound Armour, such as the Bound Chestplate.
tc.research_name.SOULARMORFORGE=Soul Armor Forge
tc.research_text.SOULARMORFORGE=[BM] Demonic Armor
tc.research_page.SOULARMORFORGE.1=The Soul Armour Forge is a block added by Blood Magic. The Soul Armour Forge is used to create the pieces of the Bound Armour, such as the Bound Helmet and Bound Chestplate. To create the Soul Armour Forge and all pieces of Bound Armour, 28 Filled Sockets are required. n order to use the Soul Armour Forge, it must be placed in the world and surrounded with Filled Sockets forming the shape of the desired piece of armor. In order to function properly, the Soul Armour Forge must touch as many Filled Sockets as possible with the layout, such as the picture to the right. Laying the sockets both horizontally and vertically will work.
tc.research_page.SOULARMORFORGE.2= Once the sockets have been placed, right clicking on them with a sigil, blood orb, or blood shard will place them into the sockets, binding them to that piece of armor.
tc.research_name.RUNEOFARGUMENTEDCAPACITY=Rune of Augmented Capacity
tc.research_text.RUNEOFARGUMENTEDCAPACITY=[BM] Pimp my Altar
tc.research_page.RUNEOFARGUMENTEDCAPACITY=You see the path in front of you, more clearly than anyone else. Whatever you have stored in this Blood Altar, it will not suffice for the days to come. After deep and thorough research, you find yourself facing the Rune of Augmented Capacity. Each one adds an additional 3,500 LP storage potential to the Blood Altar, allowing for health to be sacrificed in bigger batches, and also to craft new items that require more LP. This also increases the tank's internal buffer, as it is always 10% of the altar's capacity, but you find no difficulty in filling such a buffer at this point.
tc.research_name.RUNEOFDISLOCATION=Rune of Dislocation
tc.research_text.RUNEOFDISLOCATION=[BM] That was quick
tc.research_page.RUNEOFDISLOCATION=The process of transferring LP out of the Altar is slowly devouring your patience. How annoying, the awful speed of it! A resourceful mage cannot be halted by meager things like this, and your new discovery is clear proof of that. The Rune of Dislocation, as you've named it, increases the speed by which LP can be pumped into and out of the Blood Altar at a multiplicative 20% rate. You can add several of these into a bigger Altar structure, surely achieving double, triple the speed of transfer you had before. Boredom is the enemy of advancement.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFELEMENTALAFFINITY=Sigil of Elemental Affinity
tc.research_text.SIGILOFELEMENTALAFFINITY=[BM] Burned, drowned or falling to death no more
tc.research_page.SIGILOFELEMENTALAFFINITY=Even though you saw further potential in some earlier Sigils, it was clear to you they could not go beyond themselves, by themselves. The field of Thaumaturgy relies on Infusion, as does your progress in Blood Magic at this point. What would happen, then, if you combined Sigils together?<BR><BR>The result is the Sigil of Elemental Affinity. Its effects range from fall damage negation to water breathing and fire immunity, all at a small LP cost of 300 LP every 10 seconds, understandably more than the components Sigils you used in this craft.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFLIGHTNING=Sigil of Lightning
tc.research_text.SIGILOFLIGHTNING=[BA] Lightning Strike
tc.research_page.SIGILOFLIGHTNING.1=The other day, you were filling up the Altar, while heavy rain poured all around you. The sound was calming, the atmosphere was relaxing and it soothed your nerves, but a strange flash of light suddenly appeared in the reflection of the Life Essence.<BR><BR>You only had time to flinch, instinctively, at the roaring crash of a bolt of lightning only a few meters in front of you, leaving only a tree split down the middle that came to crash against the muddy soil.<BR><BR>Your body shook, you could not stop it, and at that point you knew what remained in front of you.
tc.research_page.SIGILOFLIGHTNING.2=A few days later, you resurfaced from a vitreous-eyed frenzy with the Lightning Sigil. Upon command, you can force lightning to cascade wherever you point and click, at a considerable cost of LP.<BR><BR>The Sigil has 5 different modes, each one increasing the amount of lightning you summon, but also the cost of using the Sigil, maxing out at an incredible 168,000 LP.<BR><BR>You look at your hands, healed from the initial pricks that began this journey, and you find yourself filled with a strange sensation, fuller than you have ever been. The power is not just there, it resonates with your very being, shaking with the ground under your two feet.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFHOLDING=Sigil of Holding
tc.research_text.SIGILOFHOLDING=[BM] Up to 5 Slots
tc.research_page.SIGILOFHOLDING=You have found yourself encumbered with magical trinkets in the past, and the simple, initial exploration of Sigil-related possibilies only worsens that reality. Instead, you dedicated some time to compactly carry your new tools, using the Sigil of Holding.<BR><BR>It is used to save inventory space by combining several Sigils into one. Shift right clicking with it will allow you to place (or remove) up to 5 Sigils into it, and you can switch between the Sigils that it holds by using the scroll on the mouse while holding shift. Right clicking will activate the displayed Sigil.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFAUGMENTETHOLDING=Sigil of Augmented Holding
tc.research_text.SIGILOFAUGMENTETHOLDING=[BA] Up to 9 Slots
tc.research_page.SIGILOFAUGMENTETHOLDING=The attempts at improving the Sigil of Holding have been successful, but with some unavoidable caveats. The Sigil of Augmented Holding, as you've named it, is an upgraded variant that holds 9 sigils in total, instead of 5.<BR><BR>When used, the Sigil of Augmented Holding will consume a single Sigil per sneak-right click, starting at the left of the hotbar, and ending at the right of the hotbar. Sneak-right clicking will filter between the stored Sigils, while right clicking will activate the displayed Sigil. To separate the stored sigils from the Sigil of Holding, a Ritual of Unbinding must be used.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFPHANTOMBRIDGE=Sigil of Phantom Bridge
tc.research_text.SIGILOFPHANTOMBRIDGE=[BM] Air Walker
tc.research_page.SIGILOFPHANTOMBRIDGE=You have set your eyes on the skies above, but you cannot move very well above ground. What if, you thought, you brought the ground up to you?<BR><BR>The Sigil of the Phantom Bridge, when active, creates a 5x5 platform of Spectral Blocks centered around you. These blocks can be broken instantly with a hit and right-clicking on one with another block will replace the Spectral Block. Crouching will create a layer below you, allowing for greater aerial mobility. Activating this Sigil costs 150 LP every 10 seconds while active, plus 1 LP per block created, until deactivated.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFMAGNETISM=Sigil of Magnetism
tc.research_text.SIGILOFMAGNETISM=[BM] Magic Magnet
tc.research_page.SIGILOFMAGNETISM=As you empower yourself with this new magic, you begin to move small objects to your will. Reaching towards them, you can draw them towards you, a magical magnet that you were quickly able to implant into a Sigil, creating the Sigil of Magnetism.<BR><BR>This acts as an item magnet, with a radius of five blocks, at the cost of Life Essence (LP). Upon activating the Sigil, 75 LP will be consumed from your network to act as an item magnet. Every ten seconds after activation, an additional 75 LP will be consumed to continue working.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFTHEBLOODLAMP=Sigil of the Blood Lamp
tc.research_text.SIGILOFTHEBLOODLAMP=[BM] Bloody light all around
tc.research_page.SIGILOFTHEBLOODLAMP=All of this is riddled with energy, yet there is no visible light coming from anywhere. The behavior of Life Essence is unlike that of a Vis Node, and it seems to reject acting as a source of light until enough blood is provided at once.<BR><BR>The Sigil of the Blood Lamp allows you to create a Blood Light anywhere by right-clicking a block, at a 10 LP cost. The Blood Light emits light and serves as an improved light source with less visual clutter. Right clicking the Sigil while not facing a block will shoot a small projectile, dealing half a heart of damage on impact, costing 50 LP.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFSIGHT=Sigil of Sight
tc.research_text.SIGILOFSIGHT=[BM] Blood Altar Infos for free
tc.research_page.SIGILOFSIGHT=You find yourself seeing things more clearly as your Altar structure becomes more composed. The Sigil you used before to look into the Altar's secrets can tell you more if it is treated with a good enough orb, and the result is the Sigil of Sight.<BR><BR>When used on a Blood Altar, it shows the item progress, consumption rate, current essence and input/output tanks, at no LP cost per usage. With this, you can better assess the performance of your Altar, and track it as it is upgraded.
tc.research_name.RITUALDIVINER=Ritual Diviner
tc.research_text.RITUALDIVINER=[BM] New Rituals
tc.research_page.RITUALDIVINER.1=The Ritual Diviner is an item added by the Blood Magic mod.<BR>A tool to help with the construction of Rituals. Shift+Right-clicking it will cycle through the available rituals. The tooltip will display the number and type of Ritual Stones required to build the selected ritual. Right-clicking on a Master Ritual Stone with it will place and ink the ritual stones needed for the ritual. Placing a stone will use Life Essence, a ritual stone from the user's inventory and will cause the diviner to animate and emit green particles. The ritual diviner will not replace existing blocks.
tc.research_page.RITUALDIVINER.2=If it tries and fails to place a stone it will animate but will not emit any particles. The mage will need to clear out the obstruction for placement to continue. Snow, tall grass and torches are common, yet easily overlooked, obstructions. There are 3 tiers of Diviner, tier 1 places elemental runes, tier 2 can place a dusk runes and tier 3 can place a dawn rune. There is a tooltip that indicates the tier of a diviner. Attempting to build a ritual that requires dusk runes with the diviner that can't place them will cause it to act as if the ritual is complete when it is not.
tc.research_name.RUNEOFTHEORB=Rune of the Orb
tc.research_text.RUNEOFTHEORB=[BM] More Runes
tc.research_page.RUNEOFTHEORB=In your attempts to increase the maximum storage of a Soul Network, you perceived a way to do it without having to get a better Blood Orb, by enhancing the Altar with a specific Rune dedicated to the job, the Rune of the Orb.<BR><BR>Each one increases the amount of LP that can be transferred into a Soul Network by 4% of its original value. For the Weak Blood Orb, this is 100 LP per rune, but for the Archmage's Blood Orb it becomes 200,000 LP.
tc.research_name.RUNEOFSUPERIORCAPACITY=Rune of Superior Capacity
tc.research_text.RUNEOFSUPERIORCAPACITY=[BM] More Blood
tc.research_page.RUNEOFSUPERIORCAPACITY.1=In another one of your deep exploits, you have resurfaced with a variation on a useful rune you already had. The Rune of Superior Capacity increases the capacity of the altar by 14% LP, unlike its sibling that increases it by a flat amount. These are multiplicative: two is 29%, three is 48% and so on. With fewer than 15 runes dedicated to capacity, it is more efficient to use Runes of Augmented Capacity.<BR><BR>The effects of having both runes of augmented capacity and runes of superior capacity stack, but runes of superior capacity do NOT multiply the 2,000 added by each rune of augmented capacity, only the original 10,000.
tc.research_page.RUNEOFSUPERIORCAPACITY.2=The capacity of your altar can be calculated with the formula: (3500*A) + (10000)*(1.14)^S, where A is equal to the number of Runes of Augmented Capacity and S is equal to the number of Runes of Superior Capacity are in place.
tc.research_name.RUNEOFACCELERATION=Rune of Acceleration
tc.research_text.RUNEOFACCELERATION=[BM] More Speed
tc.research_page.RUNEOFACCELERATION=The specialization of each Rune gave you an idea. Instead of increasing the amount of fluid that is transported, you can increase the speed at which a new transportation happens.<BR><BR>To accomplish this, you created the Rune of Acceleration, which increases the frequency of the Altar fluid transportations.
tc.research_name.RUNEOFQUICKNESS=Rune of Quickness
tc.research_text.RUNEOFQUICKNESS=[BM] Even More Speed
tc.research_page.RUNEOFQUICKNESS.1=If you've automated the blood transmutation process, you'll likely notice the altar always waits a certain amount of time before transmuting the next item. This delay only seems to occur when using automated means to place items on the altar.<BR><BR>This delay seems to be ingrained within the very laws of the world as accelerating time around the altar has no effect on the delay.
tc.research_page.RUNEOFQUICKNESS.2=After countless days and nights of research and experimentation, you've successfully created a new rune that manages to reduce the delay.<BR><BR>Every quickness rune added to the altar reduces the delay by around 20%. The effect is multiplicative and not additive.
tc.research_name.ARCANEPEDESTALANDPLINTH=Arcane Pedestal
tc.research_text.ARCANEPEDESTALANDPLINTH=[BM] Let's summon some Demons
tc.research_page.ARCANEPEDESTALANDPLINTH.1=The Arcane Pedestal is a block added by Blood Magic. When used in conjunction with an Arcane Plinth, the pedestals allow for the summoning of Demons and Elementals based upon what items are placed on them. The Arcane Pedestal is also used in the crafting of the Arcane Plinth.
tc.research_page.ARCANEPEDESTALANDPLINTH.2=The Arcane Plinth is a block added by Blood Magic. It is used in conjunction with Arcane Pedestals to summon Demons and Elementals. The Arcane Plinth is the center of the summoning circle, and must have the correct tier or higher blood orb placed on it in order to finish the summon.
tc.research_page.ARCANEPEDESTALANDPLINTH.3=The Arcane Plinth is the central block used to create a Summoning Circle in order to call forth demons from beyond. The Summoning Circle consists of three separate tiers, with each successive capable of summoning more powerful demons.Summoning a demon requires that you place a particular set of items upon the pedestals surrounding the Arcane Plinth. The items may be placed in any order and position. Placing an item onto a pedestal functions identically to placing items in a Blood Altar - right click with the item in hand to place it on the pedestal. You may also remove items from the Arcane Pedestal or Arcane Plinth by right clicking it with an empty hand. In addition to the required ingredients, each demon requires that a blood orb be placed atop the Arcane Plinth.
tc.research_page.ARCANEPEDESTALANDPLINTH.4=The blood orb can be placed at any time during the summoning process, or simply left atop the Arcane Plinth between summons. If the items were placed correctly lightning will strike each pedestal in turn, consuming the placed items as it strikes. When all items are consumed, the Arcane Plinth will be struck with lightning and the demon will be summoned.
tc.research_name.ALCHEMICCALCINATOR=Alchemic Calcinator
tc.research_text.ALCHEMICCALCINATOR=[BM] Brewing some magical things
tc.research_page.ALCHEMICCALCINATOR=The Alchemic Calcinator converts one reagent into 1,000 AR, consuming 2,000 LP in the process. The produced AR flows into the internal buffer of 2,000 AR, from where it slowly goes into the 4,000 AR main tank. The main tank will output to a single target container. This can be disabled by applying a Redstone signal. To insert an orb or a reagent simply Right-click the Calcinator with it. An orb must be first inserted in order to activate it. The Calcinator needs to be hooked up to a target container such as a Crystal Belljar in order to tranfer AR, set the destination using an Alchemic Router. To clear already set destinations use an Alchemic Cleanser.
tc.research_name.ALCHEMICTOOLS=Alchemic Tools
tc.research_text.ALCHEMICTOOLS=[BM] Let's link it
tc.research_page.ALCHEMICTOOLS.1=The Alchemic Router is the item needed to establish links between containers (Calcinators, Relays, Belljars & Master Ritual Stones). To create a new link, select the source container by right-clicking it with the Router. Next, select the destination container by right-clicking it with the router. The Router can be set to only create links for a certain reagent. Shift right-click a container to cycle through the different types of reagents stored. You can clear the router's saved source coordinates by shift right-clicking the router into the air. All links have a maximum range of 5 blocks (this may be subject to change).
tc.research_page.ALCHEMICTOOLS.2=The Alchemic cleanser is an item used to remove links created with the Alchemic Router. When right-clicked on any container, it removes all outgoing links from that container to others.
tc.research_page.ALCHEMICTOOLS.3=The Alchemic Segmenter can be used to limit the number of tanks used for a certain type of AR. Shift right-click on a container to cycle through its reagent types until you have the one you want to restrict. Then, left-click the target container until you have the right max number of tanks. Example: You can limit a Relay (which has two tanks) to have a maximum of 1 tank of Praesidium, 1 tank of Potentia and 1 tank of Sanctus.
tc.research_name.BELLJAR=Bell Jar
tc.research_text.BELLJAR=[BM] Demon Lamps
tc.research_page.BELLJAR=The Crystal Belljar is a block added by the Blood Magic mod. It can hold up to 16,000 AR. It can only output to a single container. The Belljar outputs a Redstone signal which varies in strength, corresponding to how full its internal storage is.
tc.research_name.ALCHEMYRELAY= Alchemy Relay
tc.research_text.ALCHEMYRELAY=[BM] More than one Calcinator
tc.research_page.ALCHEMYRELAY=The Relay has two 2,000AR tanks. Unlike the Calcinator and the Belljar, it can support multiple outgoing links. This makes this block especially useful for sorting reagents. Transmission can be stopped by applying a redstone signal.
tc.research_name.CRYSTALCLUSTER=Crystal CLuster
tc.research_text.CRYSTALCLUSTER=[BM] Tier 6. Ready set go!
tc.research_page.CRYSTALCLUSTER=You have spent long hours searching for a block that can maintain the connection within the full structure of a Tier 6 Altar. As you soon came to realize, such a block doesn't exist, the reason why no other Blood Mage ever made a concept of an Altar of this size.<BR><BR>However, the true realization that you achieved was that this material doesn't exist here, where you are located. For a mage of your caliber, the sight forward needs to look beyond this one realm, into the powerful beings of other dimensions, and their belongings... something much grander can come from this.
tc.research_name.ICHORIUMBLOCK=Tier 6 Pillar
tc.research_text.ICHORIUMBLOCK=[BM] The final Tier
tc.research_page.ICHORIUMBLOCK.1=The reflection you see in the face of this orange-golden block is nothing but exhilaration. You thought it impossible, to flow Blood Magic through this magical miracle material, seeing it reject any and all attempts of mixing with the essence.<BR><BR>Holding it in your grasp, you feel it pulsing with an intensity beyond anything you have felt since you became a Blood Mage. This, this is the foundation of the power every mage has been seeking, all this time! You can only imagine what it can do your Altar.
tc.research_page.ICHORIUMBLOCK.2=The sixth and final tier of your Blood Magic altar will require 76 additional Blood Runes, and 4 seven block pillars made of Blood-Soaked Ichorium Blocks capped with Crystal Clusters. The Tier 6 Altar allows you to unlock the full potential of your Blood Magic endeavors by way of unlocking even more and more powerful transfusion recipes.<BR><BR>Like the previous tier, the sixth ring of runes requires a two-block gap outward from the previous ring. The Ichorium Blocks need to be placed in a Tier 5 Altar to soak up the Blood and turn into this new block.
tc.research_name.GLYPHSTONE=Glyph Stone
tc.research_text.GLYPHSTONE=[BM] Omega.... What?
tc.research_page.GLYPHSTONE.1=Now its time for the Omega Ritual. So the Omega armor is an upgrade from the normal Bound Armor from Blood Magic. You hve to Building a the Omega Chamber the most complicated and most important part of the Omega ritual. The duration and protection of your Omega Armor will be almost completely based on this. The idea behind the ritual is that activating the ritual releases the reagents like a gas from the master ritual stone. However the gas must be contained in order to empower your armor, so the chamber must be completely sealed when you activate the ritual. Once the reagent gas has entered your armor, the chamber may be broken and you can exit. Because it is a gas, the volume of the chamber is not important. Every FACE of a block the is exposed to the gas once the ritual is activated counts for 1 point of stability.
tc.research_page.GLYPHSTONE.1=In order for the ritual to successfully activate, the stability needs to be 151 or higher. The higher it is, the more time you get from it. If you use Glyphs of Rigid Stability, each face exposed is worth 2 points of stability. While these are significantly more expensive than using dirt or some other block, they essentially double the overall stability of the chamber. Therefore it is best to construct the entire exterior of the chamber out of these Glyphs of Rigid Stability(except the floor which has to be the ritual stones and bell jars.
tc.research_page.GLYPHSTONE.2=In order to increase the time the Omega state lasts before reverting back to normal Bound armor, the chamber's stability needs to increase. In order to increase the enchantability, which decides how good of enchantments are on the armor, you need Glyphs of the Adept Enchanter, and in order to increase the enchantment level you, need Glyphs of Arcane Potential. The reason you cannot make your entire chamber out of the other Glyphs which add the enchantments to your armor is because each face of the Adept Enchanter Glyphs count as -10 stability points and each face of Arcane Potential is worth -20 points. This is why you need all the Glyphs of Rigid Stability, because the more of those you have, the more of the other 2 Glyphs you can have without dipping below 151 stability points.
tc.research_page.GLYPHSTONE.3=In order to achieve more than just level 1 enchantments on your armor, you need more surface area than an empty box chamber will provide, so you need to add blocks inside the chamber. But you can't just fill it with blocks because the gas needs a way to get to the faces. Think of it as if the gas flows from the Master Ritual Stone in blocks. Every time a gas block Connects with another block, the face that it connects to is counted towards the ritual.
tc.research_name.KEYOFBINDING=Key of Binding
tc.research_text.KEYOFBINDING=[BM] Binding all the Stuff
tc.research_page.KEYOFBINDING=The Key of Binding is a tool added by Blood Magic. The Key of Binding is used to bind unbound items to the owner's network.There are two types of the Key of Binding. The first being a standard, craft-able key. The second one must be spawned in, and comes pre-bound to Server-wide Soul Network, allowing for a server-wide soul network to be established by using the key. Upon right clicking, the Key of Binding will search the user's inventory for the first unbound item and will bind it to the owner of the key's network.
tc.research_name.ARMORINHIBITOR=Armor Inhibitor
tc.research_text.ARMORINHIBITOR=[BM] Used to suppress the souls
tc.research_page.ARMORINHIBITOR=While activated, the Armour Inhibitor will deactivate all armor upgrades on Bound Armor. For example, if wearing bound boots with a Sigil of Haste in them, the inhibitor will disable the haste effect. This can be useful if using armor with the Sigil of Magnetism or Sigil of the Phantom Bridge socketed. The inhibitor does not require any life essence to operate.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFHASTE=Sigil of Haste
tc.research_text.SIGILOFHASTE=[BM] You are on speed?
tc.research_page.SIGILOFHASTE=You have sought to move as quickly as the essence in your Altar, but you have achieved no improvements to your speed. Rushing the blood in your veins would kill you within seconds, your distant rational mind tells you, but reinserting it inside you with Blood Magic is a different story.<BR><BR>The Sigil of Haste grants you Boost II at the cost of Life Essence (LP). Upon activating the Sigil of Haste, and every 10 seconds, 300 LP will be consumed from the owner's network to grant the user Boost II When socketed into Bound Armor, the Sigil of Haste grants Boost.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFWHIRLWIND=Sigil of Whirlwind
tc.research_text.SIGILOFWHIRLWIND=[BM] Just blow away those arrows
tc.research_page.SIGILOFWHIRLWIND=With a flicker of the hand, far away objects will come to you, but with another they will be thrown away. You have since mastered these two gestures, and imbued them into Sigils to automatically cause the effects.<BR><BR>The Sigil of the Whirlwind, when active, deflects projectiles and arrows fired at you. Activating this Sigil costs 350 LP per use. When socketed into Bound Armor, the Sigil of the Whirlwind has the same deflection effect.
tc.research_name.SIGILOFSUPRESSION=Sigil of Supression
tc.research_text.SIGILOFSUPRESSION=[BM] Walk just like Jesus
tc.research_page.SIGILOFSUPRESSION=It's impressive, what a Blood Mage with a blank mind can come up with. You have seen the possibility to create fluids, and to delete fluids, but never to do both at the same time. What could stop a sufficienly resourceful mage from accomplishing this?<BR><BR>The Sigil of Supression, a rather fun experiment, temporarily removes any fluid source within a 5 block radius.

tc.research_text.BREWINGSTAND=[MC] Oh, its more magical than a Cauldron!
Minecraft.research_page.BREWINGSTAND.1=Brewing (or Alchemy) is the process of creating potions and splash potions by adding various ingredients to water bottles in a brewing stand. By placing bottles in the lower three slots of the brewing interface and an ingredient in the upper slot, you can distill the ingredient into the bottles and brew potions which may be consumed to grant an effect to the player. Every potion starts with a water bottle, made by filling a glass bottle at a water source or filled cauldron. The next step is to add a primary ingredient to create a base potion, which is usually Nether Wart, which creates an awkward potion and has no effects.
Minecraft.research_page.BREWINGSTAND.2=By brewing a second ingredient into a base potion in the same manner, you can create a potion with a working effect. A third ingredient may be added to make the effect more intense or last longer, or turn the effect harmful. Finally, gunpowder can be added to a potion at any stage to convert it to a splash potion, which can be thrown (or fired using a dispenser) to disperse its effect in a radius. Each brewing step takes 20 seconds. Brewing can create very useful and lifesaving items. A good number of them are useful in combat by aiding the player or weakening enemies while others can save the players life if used quickly, like Fire Resistance or Healing.
Minecraft.research_page.BREWINGSTAND.3=Gathering the Blaze Rods and Nether Wart necessary for brewing can prove challenging, but once they are set up, most potion ingredients are fairly plentiful and brewing will be a rewarding task.

tc.research_page.DrilloftheRockbreaker=After studying the Pickaxe of the Core, the Shovel of the Earthmover and the Thaumium Drill, you have managed to combine most of their abilities, resulting in an electric tool that can mine a whole 3x3x1 area of pickaxe and shovel materials very quickly.<BR><BR>This marvelous device is able to find the closest ore clusters on a shift-right click, though at the cost of some EU.
tc.research_name.ThaumiumChainsaw=Thaumium Chainsaw
tc.research_text.ThaumiumChainsaw=Felling trees and severing heads with a touch of magic.
tc.research_page.ThaumiumChainsaw=You have found a way to fuse Thaumium to a Diamond Chainsaw, allowing it to fell trees quicker and hold more power. Nevertheless, these ameliorations do not come without drawbacks: during the process of fusing these materials, the chainsaw loses its ability to shear foliage, tall grass, and animals.<BR><BR>You have an intuition you will be able to upgrade this tool in the near future.
tc.research_name.ChainsawoftheStream=Chainsaw of the Stream
tc.research_text.ChainsawoftheStream=Felling trees in a single swoop
tc.research_page.ChainsawoftheStream=After studying both the Axe of the Stream and the Thaumium Chainsaw, you managed to combine most of their abilities, resulting in an electric tool that can chop down whole trees without much effort.
tc.research_name.InventoryChargingRing=Inventory Charging Ring
tc.research_text.InventoryChargingRing=Passive charger
tc.research_page.InventoryChargingRing=While other thaumaturgists use rings to charge their runic shields, you feel that there are better applications for them.  By fusing power sources into a mundane ring, you have learned how to funnel its charging effects into electric items in your inventory instead. It doesn't generate much at only 32 EU per tick, but that just means there's room for improvement.
tc.research_name.ArmorChargingRing=Armor Charging Ring
tc.research_text.ArmorChargingRing=Passive life-saver
tc.research_page.ArmorChargingRing=You have found the low but constant recharge rate of your new ring to be more useful than anticipated, but it would be nice if it charged your armor when there wasn't a tool in need of power.  By infusing a few more power sources and a piece of armor, you have found a way to have it do just that. Sadly, the new power sources do not increase the recharge rate, but progress is progress.
tc.research_name.ElectricGogglesofRevealing=Electric Goggles of Revealing
tc.research_text.ElectricGogglesofRevealing=The best of both worlds
tc.research_page.ElectricGogglesofRevealing=You have found a way to detect auras using purely electronic means, no longer requiring mystical energy that can be depleted over time. You can now create a pair of Goggles of Revealing that can be recharged with EU while being able to see Aura Nodes just as you could before. A diamond helmet is required to house the sensitive vis sensing circuitry and prevent it from being damaged, which also has the added benefit of providing extra protection.
tc.research_name.NanosuitGogglesofRevealing=Nanosuit Goggles of Revealing
tc.research_text.NanosuitGogglesofRevealing=Top-tier eye protection
tc.research_page.NanosuitGogglesofRevealing=You have discovered a way to incorporate your previous vis sensors to a Nanosuit Helmet without moving too much around. By infusing the nano helmet with magic, you will be able to use it to see Aura Nodes. During the magical process, the control circuits for the night vision feature are replaced with capacitors to absorb the excess magical energy and vis-sensing microchips. This will prevent you from turning off the night vision effect of the helmet.
tc.research_name.QuantumGogglesofRevealing=Quantum Goggles of Revealing
tc.research_text.QuantumGogglesofRevealing=Protection coupled with utility
tc.research_page.QuantumGogglesofRevealing=It took a lot of trial and error, but you have found a way to slip in vis detection sensors to a Quantum Helmet. By infusing the quantum helmet with magic, you will be able to use it to see Aura Nodes. During the design process, you had to replace several control circuits that involve night vision and automatic feeding with vis detecting circuitry and capacitors to absorb the excess magical energy. You find that using a Mining Laser to contain it can safely focus and direct the explosive pulse where the vision effect and the feeding unit of the helmet lie. Have fun getting force-fed energy. This will prevent you from turning off the night vision and feeding features.
tc.research_name.SolarHelmetofRevealing=Solar Helmet of Revealing
tc.research_text.SolarHelmetofRevealing=The sunlight hurts my eyes
tc.research_page.SolarHelmetofRevealing=You now have a helmet that acts exactly like your quantum goggles of revealing, but can also recharge your chest armor! It generates 2048 EU/t during the day, and 128 EU/t at night.
tc.research_name.CompressedSolars=Compressed Solar Panels
tc.research_text.CompressedSolars=Increase the efficiency!
tc.research_page.CompressedSolars=You have found a way to compress 8 mundane Solar Panels in a magical one, that acts as if it was made of 10 mundane solar panels, generating 10 EU/t. You may repeat this process with compressed solar panels, allowing you to increase the power potential per block even higher. You can also, by magical infusion, create triple compressed solar panels, taking the folly a step further.
tc.research_name.WaterInfusedSolarPanels=Water Infused Solar Panels
tc.research_text.WaterInfusedSolarPanels=Curse you rain!
tc.research_page.WaterInfusedSolarPanels=You always hated rain, especially when all your power came from Solar Panels. You hated it so much that you decided to find a way to make your Solar Panels keep running during rain. You managed... kind of. The Water Infused Solar Panels work during rain, and during rain only.
tc.research_name.EntropyInfusedSolarPanels=Entropy Infused Solar Panels
tc.research_text.EntropyInfusedSolarPanels=Not afraid of the dark
tc.research_page.EntropyInfusedSolarPanels=You know that Solar Panels stop working at nighttime. To counter that, you found a way to make your Solar Panels produce energy at night!
tc.research_name.OrderInfusedSolarPanels=Order Infused Solar Panels
tc.research_text.OrderInfusedSolarPanels=I've got the power!
tc.research_page.OrderInfusedSolarPanels=Harnessing the power of Order, you have managed to triple the output of your Solar Panels at day!
tc.research_name.FireInfusedSolarPanels=Fire Infused Solar Panels
tc.research_text.FireInfusedSolarPanels=Where it is hot and dangerous...
tc.research_page.FireInfusedSolarPanels=Fascinated by the Nether, you created a monster. These Solar Panels work like normal in the Overworld, but also produce more energy when they are located in the Nether! A monster I tell you...
tc.research_name.AirInfusedSolarPanels=Air Infused Solar Panels
tc.research_text.AirInfusedSolarPanels=Don't be afraid of heights
tc.research_page.AirInfusedSolarPanels=Your adventurous mind and the natural amount of air existing at the top of the world make these Solar Panels yield more energy when located over Y = 160.
tc.research_name.EarthInfusedSolarPanels=Earth Infused Solar Panels
tc.research_text.EarthInfusedSolarPanels=Not for claustrophobic persons
tc.research_page.EarthInfusedSolarPanels=You have decided to get closer to the core. These Solar Panels produce more energy under Y = 10, but keep in mind the rebellious spirits need to be able to see the sun to work.
tc.research_name.ElectricHoeofGrowth=Electric Hoe of Growth
tc.research_text.ElectricHoeofGrowth=Shockingly natural
tc.research_page.ElectricHoeofGrowth=You have managed to upgrade your Hoe of Growth. It now delivers little shocks to the land and plants around it, much like your regular Hoe of Growth would do. <BR><BR>However, the magic contained within this tool is too powerful for you to convert it fully to using mundane electricity, for the tool still has a limited number of uses before it breaks, but is rechargeable.
tc.research_name.ElectricScribingTools=Electric Scribing Tools
tc.research_text.ElectricScribingTools=Save squiddy!
tc.research_page.ElectricScribingTools=You have decided not to kill any more squid. Therefore, you researched a way to charge your scribing tools, in a way which would make them not need any ink. Thanks to static electricity, and the ball pen technology, you managed to make the ink inside the scribing tools spin so quickly, that EU can recharge it.
tc.research_name.Mjolnirnew=MjolniR
tc.research_text.Mjolnirnew=Godly power
tc.research_page.Mjolnirnew=You have travelled the world, in quest for the mighty Hammer of Thor. One day, you stumbled upon its broken remains, and your heart crumbled with it. After some long and tedious research, you found a way to restore this magnificent tool to its past greatness.<BR><BR>You have an odd feeling, (you seem to have a lot of these), that although this tool is amazingly powerful, you could do more with it.
tc.research_name.SuperchargedMjolnir=Supercharged Mjolnir
tc.research_text.SuperchargedMjolnir=Making it yours
tc.research_page.SuperchargedMjolnir=After some more exploration of the dungeons existing all around the worlds and dimensions, you have managed to find a method that makes you able to overpower Thor's power, making his Hammer yours. Furthermore, you have managed to make your Hammer summon defenders, some strange Snow-Golem like creature that shall protect you. However, the hammer lost its power to summon lightning where you desire it to, and creates a ring of lightning around you.
tc.research_name.LightningSummoner=Lightning Summoner
tc.research_text.LightningSummoner=From vilest enemies
tc.research_page.LightningSummoner=This item is dropped by your archenemy, the Supercharged Creeper. You feel it is going to be very useful later on.<BR><BR>If you don't have any luck I have a recipe for you to make this magic ball of lightning
tc.research_name.TinyUranium=Tiny Uranium
tc.research_text.TinyUranium=Some shrinkage may occur
tc.research_page.TinyUranium=After processing all your ores and using them for the creation of nuclear reactors, you have finally run out of uranium nuggets, needed to make your beloved fuel rods. After long research sessions, you have managed to transform your leftover uranium into much-needed nuggets!<BR><BR>Unfortunately, this process is a bit wasteful, but you believe it to be worth the cost.
tc.research_name.UUMatterInfusion=UUMatter Infusion
tc.research_text.UUMatterInfusion=A magically charged metamorphic liquid...
tc.research_page.UUMatterInfusion=You have always found the powers possessed by UU-Mater very strange, even... magical looking, especially the ability to take a large number of shapes if manipulated correctly. And here you are, having discovered a way to shape the liquid through the process of Infusion Crafting. Many recipes are available, and all of them use between 4 to 32 of each primal aspect.
tc.research_name.PortableNode=Portable Node
tc.research_text.PortableNode=Randomly convenient
tc.research_page.PortableNode=After studying in an in-depth manner of the wonders of Node Jarring, you have managed to create an item capable of spawning a random node. However, due to some parts of node magic which you cannot understand, this Portable Node will always be Fading and Unstable. <BR><BR>You can only get rid of it by a shift-right click, and you think that you should dispose of it as soon as possible, for unstable nodes are... rather unpredictable.
tc.research_name.ShieldFocus=Shield Focus
tc.research_text.ShieldFocus=S.H.I.E.L.D.
tc.research_page.ShieldFocus=With some experimentation with the Portable Hole, you have found out more about the transportation of objects to alternative dimensions. You believe you can reverse these effects to summon a swath of blocks from a dimension full of matter to shield you from any oncoming disaster. Caution is to be taken when using this focus, as when bringing these blocks into our dimension, it will transpose any blocks in the way into the dimension it came from, never to return again. You will also be unable to move while this shield is in existence.
tc.research_name.ShieldBlock=Shield Block
tc.research_text.ShieldBlock=Magical protection
tc.research_page.ShieldBlock=After studying the blocks created by the shield focus, you have discovered how to recreate them yourself, without relying on them to be summoned by the focus. They are highly blast resistant, and even resistant to nukes. However, in the event of an actual nuclear explosion, while the shield blocks will survive the aftermath, the surrounding blocks will not.<BR><BR>These blocks are unstable and do not drop when broken, even when Silk Touch is used.
tc.research_name.KristmasFocus=Kris-tmas Focus
tc.research_text.KristmasFocus=Ho! Ho! Ho!
tc.research_page.KristmasFocus=Merry Christmas!<BR><BR>You have found a novel use for the frost focus. By exposing it to the magic of Christmas, you can summon your snowy friends at will to fire snowballs at your Festivus celebrating neighbours!
tc.research_name.EnergyBallFocus=Energy Ball Focus
tc.research_text.EnergyBallFocus=Not a toy
tc.research_page.EnergyBallFocus=It's necessary to put on the BatPack or nano/quantum chestplate for using this focus. You need 5120EU to create one ball. It's not recommended for using in a closed space!
tc.research_name.ExplosionFocus=Explosion Focus
tc.research_text.ExplosionFocus=Use only in well-ventilated areas
tc.research_page.ExplosionFocus=You have found a way to improve the Nine Hells focus. By exposing the bats to the explosive properties of a Mining Laser, you have built a focus that acts similarly to the Laser but uses vis instead of EU. However, its effects are incredibly unstable, so you make a note to be careful.
tc.research_name.WandFocusCharging=Wand Focus: Charging
tc.research_text.WandFocusCharging=From vis to electricity
tc.research_page.WandFocusCharging=You realized you always carry a wand with you, along with your electric stuff. But sometimes, you have run out of juice in your electric tools. That's why you created this wand focus. It is very simple, yet very useful, for it drains vis from your wand storage, and charges the items using mundane electricity.
tc.research_name.WandFocusWandCharging=Wand Focus: Wand Charging
tc.research_text.WandFocusWandCharging=From electricity to vis
tc.research_page.WandFocusWandCharging=You've discovered a way to take the benefits of the Industrial Recharge station and house them inside of a Charging Focus, reversing its polarity.  Now it will drain electricity from your items in order to recharge your wand, albeit at a rather high cost. Furthermore, you have realized that you need a full set of Electric Armor to be able to start the wand charging process.
tc.research_name.PotentiaGenerator=Potentia Generator
tc.research_text.PotentiaGenerator=Harnessing the power-producing potential of Essentia
tc.research_page.PotentiaGenerator=After much studying and researching, you have finally discovered how to create electricity from your leftover Essentia.<BR><BR>Simply place a Warded Jar containing Potentia in a 4 blocks radius of the machine and it will draw it in to create EU.<BR><BR>While Potentia seems like the most logical choice for producing EU with Essentia, you believe you will be able to generate electricity from different Essentia in the near future with a bit of tinkering. <BR><BR>All Essentia Generators give out Gregtech EU, so no transformers are needed, you can make a book containing Information about Essentia Burn Values by putting a Book, a LV circuit and any shard in an MV Assembler
tc.research_name.IgnisGenerator=Ignis Generator
tc.research_text.IgnisGenerator=If you can't handle the heat...
tc.research_page.IgnisGenerator=Just as you thought, with a bit of tweaking, you have found a way to instead use Ignis Essentia to produce power. On the inside, this machine is able to heat water by consuming Ignis. The steam produced by this heat then spins the turbines, similar to a typical generator.
tc.research_name.AuramGenerator=Auram Generator
tc.research_text.AuramGenerator=Harnessing the magic in the air
tc.research_page.AuramGenerator=Though it took a bit more work than you initially thought, you have found a way to produce EU using Auram Essentia. This required a complete reworking of the machine, relying on Auram's pulsating magical power to spin a generator.
tc.research_name.ArborGenerator=Arbor Generator
tc.research_text.ArborGenerator=Bringing power generation back to its basics
tc.research_page.ArborGenerator=You always seem to have excess Arbor Essentia sitting around. Not anymore! By modifying your original Potentia Generator, you have found a way to produce energy using Arbor Essentia instead.
tc.research_name.AerGenerator=Aer Generator
tc.research_text.AerGenerator=Compressing your environment
tc.research_page.AerGenerator=You have discovered the enormous power of the air, and therefore decided to try out a modification of your original Potentia Generator capable of compressing air from Aer Essentia in a nearby jar.
tc.research_name.LucrumGenerator=Lucrum Generator
tc.research_text.LucrumGenerator=Greed is Good...?
tc.research_page.LucrumGenerator=Your greed kept you going further, so you have found a way to convert Lucrum to power.<BR><BR>By Infusing the Potentia Generator with huge amounts of gold, Permutatio and Lucrum, you managed to build a powerful generator that literally runs on gold.<BR><BR>But as you thought, the Infusion is unstable and will fail easily when you are not prepared.
tc.research_name.EssentiaFiller=Essentia Filler
tc.research_text.EssentiaFiller=Fill her up!
tc.research_page.EssentiaFiller=It's been a long time since you discovered the flow of Essentia, now you found a way to move essentia into Essentia Hatches.
tc.research_name.LargeEssentiaGenerator=Large Essentia Generator
tc.research_text.LargeEssentiaGenerator=Burn everything
tc.research_page.LargeEssentiaGenerator=This must be it. All your efforts to making the Essentia generators finally paid off. You managed to make a schematic for a reactor-like structure that will allow you to create Energy out of almost anything. The only remaining problems are the Chamber and the Walls of this structure.
tc.research_name.EssentiaDiffusionCells=Essentia Diffusion Cells
tc.research_text.EssentiaDiffusionCells=Take them apart
tc.research_page.EssentiaDiffusionCells=The inner chamber of your Large Essentia Generator needs to widstand the highest mechanical and magical pressure. It also needs a special catalyst that will activate the Essentia, but your efforts with a Primordial Pearl have failed, they just weren't strong enough...
tc.research_name.MagicContainingCasings=Magic Containing Casings
tc.research_text.MagicContainingCasings=Keeping the Magic inside
tc.research_page.MagicContainingCasings=The outer layer of your Large Essentia Generator needs to keep the Essential Radiation in place, but needs to be cooled as well. The only solution you found in this topic are Force-Fields.
tc.research_name.IndustrialWandChargingStation=Industrial Wand Charging Station
tc.research_text.IndustrialWandChargingStation=Charging your wand the industrial way
tc.research_page.IndustrialWandChargingStation=You have managed to combine the powers of the Wand Pedestal with those of the mighty UU-Matter, resulting in a machine capable of replicating aspects on your wand, at the cost of 50000 EU to recharge every aspect on the wand of 1 unit.
tc.research_name.EtheralProcessor=Etheral Processor
tc.research_text.EtheralProcessor=The sky is blue...
tc.research_page.EtheralProcessor=After taping into hell's power with the Infernal Furnace to get some rewards out of your mining sessions, you have something totally different in mind. You are now using the power of the Good, the Sky and the so called Paradise. This Ethereal Processor doubles the yield of every smelting recipe, and gives a 10% chance of getting a Thaumium Nugget as a bonus. You can see two drawbacks to this: as it doubles your smelting yield, it takes twice the time to process an item. As it is a highly magical device, some mundane smelting recipes do not seem to work. You are confident that smelting cobblestone into stone will not work in this wonder-machine.
tc.research_name.ResearchCompleter=Automated Research
tc.research_text.ResearchCompleter=No more ordo spam
tc.research_page.ResearchCompleter=It was fun at first, but you've decided it's time to find a better way to handle all this research. By mixing technology and magic you have come up with a multiblock that can complete a research note by itself.<BR><BR>To function, it needs nodes to be placed in the center of the structure and will slowly destroy them while running. Node stabilizers are optional but recommended for keeping so many nodes close together without them destroying each other.
tc.research_name.HEALINGFRAME=Healing Frame
tc.research_text.HEALINGFRAME=[EB] The Bees will never die ?
ExtraBees.research_page.HEALINGFRAME=The Healing Frame is an Item used in an Apiary, which increases a Queens lifespan at the cost of a lesser productivity and a decreased mutation rate. It increases a bees lifespan 50% while reducing its productivity to 75% and the chance of mutation to only 50%. It is constructed using Clay and an Impregnated Frame. In an Alveary structure, the Frame Housing can be added to make use of the Frame.
tc.research_name.CHOCOLATEFRAME=Chocolate Frame
tc.research_text.CHOCOLATEFRAME=[EB] Feeding the Bees
ExtraBees.research_page.CHOCOLATEFRAME_1=The Chocolate Frame is an item used in an Apiary or Alveary Frame Housing , which increases a Queens productivity at the cost of a shorter lifespan. One Chocolate Frame increases the production of the Queen by 50% while reducing her lifespan by 50%. The effects of multiple frames stack multiplicatively, so three Chocolate Frames will make the Lifespan for a Longest life Queen four minutes instead of the usual thirty two. It is constructed using Cocoa Beans and an Impregnated Frame. Chocolate Frames are most often employed to speed up generational turnover, when cloning Princesses for a pure strain or breeding for traits.
ExtraBees.research_page.CHOCOLATEFRAME_2=For increased production, Forestrys standard Frames are more effective, unless the apiary is set up to automatically replace the drones and princess when the queen dies; in this case the chocolate frame will speed up production.
tc.research_name.RESTRAINTFRAME=Restraint Frame
tc.research_text.RESTRAINTFRAME=[EB] A Bee Cage ?
ExtraBees.research_page.RESTRAINTFRAME=The Restraint Frame is an Item used in an Apiary, which decreases a bees range at the cost of lesser productivity and a shorter lifespan. The lifespan and production are both reduced to 75%. The bees territory is decreased to 50%, meaning that special effects such as poison or aggression have a smaller range. The Restraint Frame is only considered useful in special cases, as a bees damaging effects can also be cancelled out using Apiarists Clothes. In an Alveary structure, the Frame Housing can be added to make use of the Frame.
tc.research_name.SOULFRAME=Soul Frame
tc.research_text.SOULFRAME=[EB] Feeding the Bees
ExtraBees.research_page.SOULFRAME=The Soul Frame is an Item used in an Apiary, which increases the chance of getting a different type of Bee species at the cost of drastically reduced production and a shorter lifespan. It increases the chance of mutation by 50% of the initial mutation chance. The lifespan is reduced to 75% while production is reduced to 25% of its original value. In an Alveary structure, the Frame Housing can be added to make use of the Frame.
tc.research_name.EXURINGS=Be free like a bird ... (Theorie)
tc.research_text.EXURINGS=[ExU] The way to the sky! - Part I
tc.research_page.EXURINGS.1=Happy to have crafted or looted your first Copter Pack or in general having access to Jetpacks?<BR>Annoyed about the fact that you need some type of fuel or energy for your Jetpack to work?<BR>What would a Thaumaturge give to achieve the ability to fly without these restrictions?<BR>Maybe some §oWarp§r? Not at this point yet, maybe later?<BR>But what should you do now to achieve §oFreedom like a bird§r? Maybe you remember Icarus and what happened to him?
tc.research_page.EXURINGS.2=If you remeber (well, let us say §othat§r you remember) then why not taking a look the §oTraveller's Wings§r§r? For me they could be the key for what you want to achieve but even if you own them, what should you do with them?<BR> I would like to ... try to infuse them with ... what items would you need you may ask and the final result will be ...?<BR>Pretty out of ideas I see so let us make some theoretical studies first:<BR>You want to fly like a bird? Try to get §oVolatus§r because it is referenced to flight. Another ingredient could be §oTempestas§r to withstand the harsh weather out there.
tc.research_page.EXURINGS.3=The next as obvious would be §oPraecantatio§r as we are going to use magic after all to achieve your goal otherwise it wouldn't make sense, wouldn't it? Also §oMotus§r will be required.<BR>Well done, we got the §oMain Aspects§r but how can we get rid of requiring energy or fuel? I would suggest to get §oNebrisum§r the source of §oCheatines§r. Yes, you are right, we are going to cheat a little bit for your goal but don't blame me for that §oTerminus§r I couldn't withstand to use it.<BR>You should have a few Jars filled with §oVolatus, Tempestas, Praecantatio, Nebrisum, Motus§r and §oTerminus§r to be prepared.<LINE>
tc.research_page.EXURINGS.4=Now it is time to find out which items you would need for the infusion as well as the item to be infused with.<LINE> From the secound page we have the §oTraveller's Wings§r which I would suggest to be used as the key item and infuse them with all other items at the §oInfusion Altar§r.<BR> At last you would need §oNether Stars§r and §oAngel Blocks§r the first part of ingredients.<LINE>
tc.research_page.EXURINGS.5=Now we are getting to the downside of this list ... gregified items are also used for ... reasons.<LINE> The first downside will be from GT++:<BR>§oMagical Feather§r at last two of them which requiring you to be in §oEV Age§r before you can continue at this point. Last ones which I throw to you will be two §oEngraved Gold Chips§r, one §oIchorium Rings§r and two §oTritanium Screws§r.<BR>Congrats, you gathered all the materials you'll need ... theoretically. So now go out and get them and come back to me when you have acquired them.<LINE>
tc.research_page.EXURINGS.6=The next research will show you the recipes for your beloved item: §oExU's Angel Ring§r and they come in different styles too.<LINE>

tc.research_text.EXURINGS_CRAFTING=[ExU] The way to the sky! - Part II
tc.research_page.EXURINGS_CRAFTING.1=Ok, you got all the items and jarred essentia? Oh and thanks for taking some warp because warp is fun, isn't it? Well at last it is the payment<LINE>Fine here are all the recipes you wanted. Have fun with them but don't blame me for there own difficulty to aquire them before you can use them finally in these recipes.<LINE>First recipe: Angel Ring (Invisible Wings)<BR>Oh, totally forgotten to tell you about some §oPearl§r and §oCharms§r, sorry.
tc.research_page.EXURINGS_CRAFTING.2=So you assumed to get an Arcane Recipe here for all these different variants? Nope, it will be Infusion too as the Arcane Table can't handle the power which is hidden within this powerful item. For this time take a look on the following recipes to get all the items and the essentia together.<LINE>Second and following ones are Angel Rings with the following options: Golden Wings, Dragon Wings, Feathery Wings, Fairy Wings.<BR>Note that when you have transmogrified your wings that this step is final. This means, that you need at last five rings to own the complete collection ... whyever you would do this.
tc.research_name.JOURNEY=A long Journey
tc.research_text.JOURNEY=[FM] There must be more Magic!
derp.research_page.JOURNEY=The Thaumonomicon told you about purple trees with white leaves and about colorful sparkeling flowers, but you simple were unable to find them in the world, it seems that they don't exist.<BR> You decited to create these Objects yourself. You're a Thaumaturge, you don't care if things exist or not, you can simpley create them on your own, but it will take further investigation to do so.
tc.research_name.ROD_livingwood=Livingwood Rod
tc.research_text.ROD_livingwood=[FM] A living Wand Rod?
derp.research_page.ROD_livingwood=You know you could do it! Livingwood could only be created by a flower, until now. By infusing a mundane greatwood rod with, the essence of life, some moss and victus essentia, you were able to create a wandrod out of Livingwood, that can store up to 100 vis. That result is astounding, but you think that you can do better.
tc.research_name.ROD_dreamwood_v2=Dreamwood Rod
tc.research_text.ROD_dreamwood_v2=[FM] Sweet dreams are made of these
derp.research_page.ROD_dreamwood_v2=Livingwood is quite useful, but it can't be turned into a staff, it's just to unstable. You heard about dreamwood, which is quite stable, but requires elven magic and you have no idea where you can get an elve from. Maybe it is possible to just stabalize your livingwood rod with some magical crystals and a bit of Silverwood. The thaumonomicon told you that this has to be done in the elven world, but you simply tried to use more auram, which seemed to work aswell. <BR> You new rod now holds exact the same amount of vis than the old one, but it can be turnd into a staff and looks much more stylish.
tc.research_name.ROD_dreamwood_staff_v2=Dreamwood Staff
tc.research_text.ROD_dreamwood_staff_v2=[FM] Oh, fantasy free me!
derp.research_page.ROD_dreamwood_staff_v2=You finally are able to build a staff out of dreamwood, just add a primal charm, some crystal clusters and two rods together and you've got you new staff, that holds up to 250 vis of each type.
tc.research_name.CAP_manasteel=Manasteel Caps
tc.research_text.CAP_manasteel=[FM] The secret of Mana
derp.research_page.CAP_manasteel=Manasteel is the Botanical equivalent to Thaumium, so it should be possible to create caps out of it, by infusing some silver caps with some electrotine and astral silver you were able to create a cap with the strength of blue alloy and a higher magical conductivity than mundane silver. The vis discount is the same as Thaumium, you think thats the reason why it is call Botanical Thaumium.
tc.research_name.CAP_terrasteel=Terrasteel Wand Caps
tc.research_text.CAP_terrasteel=[FM] Completion!
derp.research_page.CAP_terrasteel=You've read about a metal, that's completely charged with magical energies that it could even summon demons, you don't think that's true, but it's worth a try. Just infuse you manasteel caps again with some steel leafs, crystal clusters and add a few jars of praecantatio essentia and see what happens, maybe it will be the best wand cap existing in this world.
tc.research_name.CAP_elementium=Elementium Wand Caps
tc.research_text.CAP_elementium=[FM] Eco Friendly Wand Caps
derp.research_page.CAP_elementium=What would happen if you combine you Manasteel caps with power of elemental shards? Instead of thinking about what could happen, you simply tried it, since the shards seem to resist the cap you decided to use some tungstensteel screws to bind it all together. The result is a metal, that has a higher vis discount than thaumium. Sadly it has to be reinfused, due to it's new non magical components.
tc.research_name.VINTEUM=Vinteum
tc.research_text.VINTEUM=[FM] Thaumium's smaller brother
derp.research_page.VINTEUM=Every Thaumaturge knows about Thaumium, it is fairly easy to produce and is a great magical conductor. More skilled Thaumaturges prefer using vinteum instead. Vintum is similar to Thaumium, but can also be turned into gems, due to it's more ordered molecular structure. You just have to reorganize some Thaumium to turn it into vinteum, just throw it into a cauldron with some Permutatio and Ordo in it, that should be enough.
tc.research_name.CAP_vinteum=Vinteum Caps
tc.research_text.CAP_vinteum=[FM] They're blue!
derp.research_page.CAP_vinteum=Since vinteum is just reorganized Thaumium, you can't expect that it gives you a higher vis discount, but since it is much more ordered you can directly use it's full magical potential, which means no infusion required
tc.research_name.ROD_witchwood=Witchwood Rod
tc.research_text.ROD_witchwood=[FM] That's witchcraft
derp.research_page.ROD_witchwood=You had no luck finding a purple tree to make a wand of, now it's time to create it on your own. With the twig of a mighty tree creature, you should have the best possible starting material. Combined with some of the most magical trees you know it should make a pretty good wand rod. <BR> This Wand is able to store 100 vis of each type, quite a nice result.
tc.research_name.ROD_witchwood_staff=Witchwood Staff
tc.research_text.ROD_witchwood_staff=[FM] Without Circle Magic
derp.research_page.ROD_witchwood_staff=Witchwood doesn't like Elemental shards, that's interesting, but a fundamental problem when it comes to create a staff out of it. It loses some capacity when doing so, but it works.
tc.research_name.PROVENFRAME=Proven Frame
tc.research_text.PROVENFRAME=[FR] Better than Impregnated Frames
Forestry.research_page.PROVENFRAME=The Proven Frame is an item used in an Apiary. Each frame doubles the bees productivity. Out of the three Forestry frames (Untreated, Impregnated and Proven), the Proven Frame has the longest durability.<BR> Proven Frames are normally only obtainable through trading with an Apiarist Villager. The Villager will trade six Proven Frames for one Emerald.<BR> Now you find a magical way put different Bee products and infuse a impregnated Frame to get a Proven Frame. In an Alveary structure, the Frame Housing can be added to make use of the Frame.
tc.research_name.PROVENGRAFTER=Proven Grafter
tc.research_text.PROVENGRAFTER=[FR] Better than a Bronze Grafter
Forestry.research_page.PROVENGRAFTER=The Proven Grafter is significantly stronger than the Bronze Grafter and can be obtained by trading with villagers. Like its counterparts the Bronze Grafter and the Thaumium Grafter it makes it possible for one to achieve a 100% sapling drop rate from trees that have been bred with the Forestry mod.<BR> It does not work on ordinary trees, and when it breaks the last hit does not retrieve a sapling.<BR> Now you find a magical way to infuse a bronze Grafter with saplings and pollen to get a proven one.
tc.research_name.MAGICAPIARY=Magic Apiary
tc.research_text.MAGICAPIARY=[MB] Magical Apiary.
MagicBees.research_page.MAGICAPIARY=The Magic Apiary works similarly to the regular Apiary, with 1x base Territory, Mutation, Lifespan, and Flowering modifiers, 0.9x Production modifier, and 0.8 Genetic Decay modifier. When an Apiary Booster of any type is placed nearby, the Apiary will consume aspects to enable 2x (or 1/2) boosts for, in order from left to right: Mutation, Death Rate, Production. Enabling death rate will halve lifespan. Its useful when all youre interested in is breeding, and dont have access to Oblivion Frames.

tc.research_text.GENTLEFRAME=[MB] Magic Living Frame
MagicBees.research_page.GENTLEFRAME=The Gentle Frame is an Item used in an Apiary, which increases a Queen's lifespan and production at the cost of a slightly lower mutation rate. It has a durability of 200, which is slightly shorter than average. The Gentle Frame increases a bee's lifespan by 50% and its productivity by 40%. Its mutation rate is lowered by 30%, leaving it at 70% of its initial mutation rate. With each durability use/bee cycle, the Gentle Frame will deplete the nearby Aura by one point. Additionally, Sano and Victus Flux will be released into the Aura. In an Alveary structure, the Frame Housing can be added to make use of the Frame.
tc.research_name.RESILIENTFRAME=Resilient Frame
tc.research_text.RESILIENTFRAME=[MB] Magic Production Frame
MagicBees.research_page.RESILIENTFRAME=The Resilient Frame is an Item used in an Apiary, which doubles the bee's productivity. It has a durability of 840, making it the most durable frame available. The Resilient Frame is the longer-lasting counterpart to the Magic Frame. With each durability use/bee cycle, the Resilient Frame will deplete the nearby Aura by two points. Additionally, Tutamen Flux will be released into the Aura. In an Alveary structure, the Frame Housing can be added to make use of the Frame.
tc.research_name.NECROTICFRAME=Necrotic Frame
tc.research_text.NECROTICFRAME=[MB] Magic Killing Frame
MagicBees.research_page.NECROTICFRAME=The Necrotic Frame is an Item used in an Apiary, which drastically decreases a Queen's lifespan and productivity. It has a durability of 270. The Necrotic Frame decreases a bee's lifespan to only 30% and its productivity to 75%. With each durability use/bee cycle, the Necrotic Frame will deplete the nearby Aura by one point. Additionally, a significant amount of Mortuus and Venenum Flux will be released into the aura. In an Alveary structure, the Frame Housing can be added to make use of the Frame.
tc.research_name.METABOLICFRAME=Metabolic Frame
tc.research_text.METABOLICFRAME=[MB] Magic Drug Frame
MagicBees.research_page.METABOLICFRAME=The Metabolic Frame is an Item used in an Apiary, which drastically increases a bee's mutation rate as well as a slight increase in it's production. It has a durability of 130. The Metabolic Frame increases the mutation rate by 80% and its production by 20%.
tc.research_name.TEMPORALFRAME=Temporal Frame
tc.research_text.TEMPORALFRAME=[MB] Magic Time Frame
MagicBees.research_page.TEMPORALFRAME=The Temporal Frame is an Item used in an Apiary, which drastically increases a Queen's lifespan to 150%. It has a durability of 300. Out of all Frames, the Temporal Frame gives the highest lifespan increase. With each durability use/bee cycle, the Temporal Frame will deplete the nearby Aura by one point. However, a significant amount of Tempus Flux will be released into the aura. In an Alveary structure, the Frame Housing can be added to make use of the Frame.
tc.research_name.OBLIVIONFRAME=Oblivion Frame
tc.research_text.OBLIVIONFRAME=[MB] Magic Production Frame
MagicBees.research_page.OBLIVIONFRAME=The Oblivion Frame is an item added by the Magic Bees mod. Placed in an Apiary or inserted in a Frame Housing within an Alveary, it reduces the lifespan of the residing Queen to a single life cycle (27.5 sec) allowing for very rapid bee breeding. However, an Oblivion Frame draws about 15 Vis per use from the air and releases Tempus aspects into the aura as flux. The Oblivion Frame does not function if used alongside another frame, and that would cause it to take a lot of damage

OpenBlocks.research_page.GOLDENEGG=The Golden Egg is a block from the OpenBlocks mod. This block is used to summon the Baby Mini Me. Before it hatches, it will begin to slowly spin in circles. After many spins, it will grow and emit large amounts of light. It will then float into the air, and explode. The explosion is minor, and should only break a single layer of standard resistance blocks. Right before it explodes, it will lift surrounding blocks into the air, then drop them back into place.

WARPTHEORY.research_page.WARPWARNING.1=Thaumcraft offers considerable power from its devices and tools. But power comes with a price.... That price is represented by Warp: A corruption of the character's mind and soul, inflicting progressively more dire effects upon them. While the effects of warp can range from annoying to deadly, accumulating enough of it can also grant you access to greater power... at the cost of increasing madness, and attention from dark powers. At least, others may call it madness... but is it truly insanity, when the voices in your head grant useful knowledge, and the monsters that appear before you leave remains behind?

tb.rec.capthauminite.page.NH.0=A thaumaturge always seeks for a way to give discovered materials a real purpose. That metal you've just unlocked, thauminite works just as thaumium, so why not use it as a wand cap ? Well, thauminite doesn't seem to be as bendable as thaumium, due to the high amount of vitreus in it. However, that property can be used to enhance regular thaumium caps. The infusion is capable of turning the thauminite into small pieces, making it able to re-crystalise directly on the thaumium caps. To ensure that cap and thauminite are bound together for  ...forever you'll also need some quicksilver and also a bit of salis mundus to reduce thauminites crystalisation time.

The result is quite nice, it grows and gets even stronger, so why not trying this with a full jar of vitium. Since you definitly dont want to taint you whole home you'll need a controlled enviroment, like the infusion. However, you should better stabilise the flask with some salis mundus, just to make sure that no taint escapes.

Witchery.research_page.KETTLE.1=Nothing invokes the image of witchcraft more than a bubbling witches kettle (or cauldron), which is used to make witches brews and later infusions.<BR>A kettle must be set up in the correct way, before it may be used. Firstly, a fire must be set under the kettle (netherrack is best for this, but wood will do just as well). Next the kettle must be filled by using a Water-filled Bucket on it. Thirdly, the ingredients for the brew or infusion must be thrown into the kettle (the liquid will change color according to the recipe being used). Finally, a glass bottle must be used on the kettle to bottle the resulting brew.
Witchery.research_page.KETTLE.2=It is important to keep the fire going constantly while the recipe is being prepared, otherwise it will be ruined. Swirls coming from the kettle is a sign all is well, black smoke (and brown liquid) indicates the brew is ruined. When a brew is ruined, the kettle must be emptied with a glass bottle, or just filled with more water, and the whole process repeated. When a brew is complete, the liquid will be the color of the resulting brew and will splutter (in addition to white swirls). Some recipes will require magical energy from a nearby Altar before they are bottled. If the brew is bottled when insufficient energy is available, the brew will be ruined. Black swirls coming from the Kettle is a good sign there is not enough power.
Witchery.research_page.KETTLE.3=A kettle must be within 14 (to 16) blocks of an Altar in order to obtain power from it (it can obtain power only from a single altar).
tc.research_name.SPINNINGWHEELW=Witchery Spinning Wheel
tc.research_text.SPINNINGWHEELW=[WI] Round and round...
Witchery.research_page.SPINNINGWHEELW=A Spinning Wheel is a device for spinning materials into thread. It is a magical device that draws power from a nearby Altar. To start spinning, place the raw material in the slot on the left, any additional ingredients in the bottom slots and the process will begin as long as there is sufficient power.<BR>The spinning wheel can be used to make Golden Thread, Fanciful Thread and Tormented Twine.
tc.research_name.RUBYSLIPPERS=Ruby Slippers
tc.research_text.RUBYSLIPPERS=[WI] Welcome home
Witchery.research_page.RUBYSLIPPERS.1=Ruby Slippers are worn in the foot slot and have the same durability and protection as leather boots. They can be enchanted like leather boots too. They cannot be dyed.<BR>Once every 30 minutes, if a player is infused, if the player chants *There's no place like home* into the chat or uses the command: *chant there's no place like home<BR> They will be teleported back to their spawn point in the same dimension, this ability costs 40% of the players total infused power (or 60% if the teleport is cross-dimensional).
Witchery.research_page.RUBYSLIPPERS.2=Alternatively, once every 60 seconds the player may drop a Bound Waystone near to themselves and use the above chant to teleport to the location of the waystone (the waystone will be consumed!).<BR> This ability saves the need to draw a circle to use the Rite of Transposition. This ability costs 20% of the players total infused power (or 40% if the teleport is cross-dimensional).<BR>Ruby Slippers will turn invisible when the player is invisible. This is only a visual change, mobs will still react as if normal shoes were worn. Other players however will not be able to see the slippers!
tc.research_name.DISTILLERY=Distillery
tc.research_text.DISTILLERY=[WI] Blub...Blub...
Witchery.research_page.DISTILLERY=A distillery used by a witch is a construct used for distilling magical ingredients. It is unlike a normal distillery, because it heats itself using energy obtained from a nearby altar, the distillery must be within about 14 (to 16) blocks of an altar to draw power from it, a small icon is shown in the interface if no power is available. One or two ingredients are distilled together and will result in up to four distillates; or resulting materials. A supply of clay jars is also needed to capture the some or all of the distillates. A distillery is crafted using a fair bit of Thaumium, a Cauldron, finely crafted pipes, clay jars, and an Attuned Stone.
tc.research_name.RITUALCHALK=Ritual Chalk
tc.research_text.RITUALCHALK=[WI] Drawing Signs
Witchery.research_page.RITUALCHALK.1=Ritual chalk is used to draw each of the white ritual glyphs that make up a ritual circle. It is also used as an ingredient in crafting the other types of chalk. To draw a ritual glyph, use the chalk on the ground. Ritual glyphs of various types will be drawn, although they all have the same function. If you use the chalk on an existing ritual glyph, a new one will be drawn in its place. <BR>Ritual chalk is crafted from Gypsum, Wood Ash and Tear of the Goddess.
Witchery.research_page.RITUALCHALK.2=Ritual glyphs should be arranged in the roughly circular patterns as illustrated in the book Witchcraft: Circle Magic. With a heart glyph drawn with Golden Chalk in the center.
tc.research_name.CIRCLETALISMAN=Circle Talisman
tc.research_text.CIRCLETALISMAN=[WI] Oh Shiny Talisman
Witchery.research_page.CIRCLETALISMAN.1=A circle talisman allows a pattern of glyphs drawn onto the ground to be bound instead to the talisman (the glyphs will disappear) and later be redrawn at a new location when then talisman is used. This makes it very easy for the witch or wizard to prepare time consuming circles in advance for rapid deployment later. <BR> To bind a circle talisman perform the Rite of Binding described in Witchcraft: Circle Magic with any pattern of circles.
Witchery.research_page.CIRCLETALISMAN.2=To deploy a bound talisman, right-click on the ground in a place with enough space to contain the pattern. You will hear a fail sound if there are obstructions and the circles cannot be placed.
tc.research_name.ALTAR=Witchery Altar
tc.research_text.ALTAR=[WI] Our Father
Witchery.research_page.ALTAR.1=An altar is a focal point to concentrate the magic present in the surrounding area into single usable source of power. Since witchcraft is a method to harness the power of nature, placing an altar in a location with little or no living things will yield very little magic to work with. There is a reason why most witches huts are found deep in dark forests or swamps!<BR>An altar is created by placing six altar blocks in a 2x3 pattern; you will know it is correct when a red cloth appears over the top of the altar.
Witchery.research_page.ALTAR.2=Activating the altar by right-clicking on it will bring up a screen showing how much power the altar has collected, how much it can collect and its current recharge rate. It is important to check that there is sufficient available power to perform a given rite or use a distillery or kettle recipe.<BR>The maximum amount of power available is determined by how many natural items are in the vicinity of the altar, dirt, grass, trees, plants, etc. all contribute; stone and sand do not. The important thing is to have a diverse mix of different plants, trees and crops (plants from other mods are supported to an extent as well).
tc.research_name.CHALICE=Chalice
tc.research_text.CHALICE=[WI] Cheers
Witchery.research_page.CHALICE=The chalice is an upgrade for an altar that improves the maximum amount of power an altar can hold. The chalice will increase the maximum power by 1x the base power rate.<BR>The chalice upgrades to the Filled Chalice. Only one chalice upgrade will have an effect on an altar.
tc.research_name.ARTHANA=Arthana
tc.research_text.ARTHANA=[WI] Ritualistic Knife
Witchery.research_page.ARTHANA.1=An Arthana is a ritualistic knife use by witches and warlocks to both collect special ingredients and to perform some rites. It has the same general properties as a golden sword (damage, enchantability, etc.), although it has the durability of an iron sword. It is repaired with a Gold Ingot.<BR>The main purpose of the dagger is to collect specialist ingredients used in witchcraft, and to this end it will dramatically improve the chance of a mob dropping such ingredients (e.g. Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, etc.). It also gives a small chance of undead dropping Spectral Dust.
Witchery.research_page.ARTHANA.2=When only using vanilla Minecraft with Witchery (and no other mods), an Arthana dagger is the only way to get a skull to drop when a skeleton is killed, the drop chance is about 5% (the skull is a key upgrade for an altar). The dagger even gives a very small probability for other head drops (from mobs and players). All drop chances are increased with the Looting enchantment.<BR>An Arthana does not change the drop chance for Wither Skeleton Skulls, that will require the Looting enchantment as usual.<BR>Some Circle Magic rites use an Arthana as a foci, the Arthana is not consumed in the proces.
tc.research_name.WARMBLOOD=Warm Blood
tc.research_text.WARMBLOOD=[WI] Mhhh warm Blood
Witchery.research_page.WARMBLOOD=The Bottle of Warm Blood is an item that can be drunk by a player. If the player is a vampire, they will restore 2 droplets of blood to the blood pool. If the player is not a vampire they will get a hunger debuff. This item allows a players to quickly get blood, or it can be used as a ingredient for the Demonic Contract.
tc.research_name.FUMEFUNNEL=Fume Funnel
tc.research_text.FUMEFUNNEL=[WI] Upgrades Yea
Witchery.research_page.FUMEFUNNEL=A fume funnel is an upgrade for the Witches Oven that increases the speed (over a normal furnace) by an additional 10%, and increases the chances of a by-product being produced by a further 25%.The Fume Funnel must be positioned next to the left or right of the witches oven with the same facing. Up to two funnels can be attached to one oven. It is possible to place a funnel between two ovens for it to benefit both. A third fume funnel can also be placed on top of an oven to make it look better and also to increase its speed by a further 10%.
tc.research_name.FUMEFILTER=Fume Filter
tc.research_text.FUMEFILTER=[WI] More By-products
Witchery.research_page.FUMEFILTER=A Fume Filter is used to upgrade a Fume Funnel to a Filtered Fume Funnel in order to increase the by-product chance of a Witches Oven.
tc.research_name.FILTEREDFUMEFUNNEL=Filtered Fume Funnel
tc.research_text.FILTEREDFUMEFUNNEL=[WI] Upgrades again? Yea!
Witchery.research_page.FILTEREDFUMEFUNNEL=A Filtered Fume Funnel is an upgrade to the Fume Funnel that increases the chance of a by-product being produced by a connected witches Oven by a further 5% above the normal Fume Funnel (for a total of +10% cook speed and +30% by-product chance). As with a Fume Funnel, an oven can only accept two Fume Funnels (whether they are upgraded or not).
tc.research_name.WAYSTONE=Waystone
tc.research_text.WAYSTONE=[WI] Teleport
Witchery.research_page.WAYSTONE=A waystone is an etched piece of flint that is an important foci for circle magic involving transposition. A waystone can be bound to a specific location using the Rite of Binding described in the book, Witchcraft: Circle Magic.<BR>A bound waystone can also be made by dropping up to eight into a hollow 3x3 circle of Otherwhere runes and waiting.
tc.research_name.RUNEDTABLET=Runed Tablet
tc.research_text.RUNEDTABLET=[NH] Boss...? Yeee is farming time
kosh.research_page.RUNEDTABLET=Your desire get to the boss? DO IT !!!
tc.research_name.CRIMSONRITES=Crimson Rites
tc.research_text.CRIMSONRITES=Unlocking the Unknown
tc.research_page.CRIMSONRITES=You have seen glimpses of powerful magic users. You think you might have found a way to unlock their secrets.

item.tconstruct.manual.common.toc=Table of Contents
item.tconstruct.manual.common.intro_link=Introduction
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.title_page=Materials and You\nSurviving the first day and beyond\n\nVolume 1\nBy Skyla
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.getting_started=Getting Started
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.armor_modifiers_header=Armor Modifiers
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.intro1=Welcome to the first edition of Materials and You: Surviving the first day and beyond. Within these pages you will find the first steps to making the tools and materials you need to survive.\n\nThis book is a magic copy; it updates whenever the original has been modified. Check back occasionally for information on new things.
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.intro2=The first step in making tools is crafting a blank pattern. It is a blank slate to stamp a shape into, providing a reference for future creations. The patterns are shaped on the Stencil Table or are used as tabletops.\n\nYou can then shape a material in a part builder with the pattern, then combine parts in the tool station. Patterns can be stored and accessed in the pattern chest.\n\nTogether these make the Tool Workshop. It is recommended you keep all of these nearby when using any of them.
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.oreberries=Oreberries\n\nSome quests will reward you with oreberries. They can be planted on crop sticks and require close to complete darkness to produce anything.\n\nThe berries can be melted down into nuggets and ingots, making them an invaluable source of metals.\n\nNote: Though Oreberries are traditionally obtained from bushes growing underground, those appear to have gone extinct.
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.oreberry_picture=Oreberries growing on crop sticks
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.slime_channels=Slime Channels\n\nSlime channels are useful for moving items or entities around. They are used as a sort of easily placeable water and can be paired with bounce pads for best effect.
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.traps=A few traps or blockades may help with your early survival experience
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.barricade=Barricade
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.smeltery_intro=Once you're well established, you can begin to process metals in a more efficient manner. The scope of the smeltery is beyond this volume, but a few recipes will help you get started.\n\nNote: The Smeltery is required to craft early-game metal tool parts. You will need a MV Extruder to craft metal parts from more advanced metals.
item.tconstruct.manual.beginner.books=If you ever find yourself without this book, a new one is simple to make. Other books can be made from this one as well.

item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page1=Tinker's Log #1:\n\nToday is a new day. I finally left home and decided to wander around in the wilderness until I find a good place to call my home. \n\nTinker's Log #2:\n\nI've decided to keep a log of my creations and machinations, as well as some insights into what I'm doing. I haven't actually built anything yet. There is a small cave I can board up for the night. I created a stone pickaxe affectionately called "Betsy".
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page2=Tinker's Log #3:\n\nThe night is scary. Creepers are everywhere, the zombies are banging on my door, bats block out the sky... it is not fun being alone out here. I want to hide in the corner and cry until they leave. This log doesn't help take my mind off of anything.\n\nTinker's Log #4:\n\nBetsy didn't last long. She just crumpled into dust suddenly and the handle shattered. My parents told me this would happen and this was normal, but it still seems so wrong. If I could make the pickaxe a little better perhaps, maybe I could repair it.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page3=Tinker's Log #5:\n\nI've spent the past three days looking for paper and ink. Squids were easy enough to find, but the sugar cane was buried deep in a ravine next to a creeper nest. Eventually I dropped rocks on the creepers and watched them explode out of surprise. My eyebrow will grow back in time.\n\nTinker's Log #6:\n\nWaiting on sugar cane to grow. Not much else today.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page4=Tinker's Log #7:\n\nI've sketched out plans for a new workbench. It's a little strange. The center of the workbench is missing, but sturdy, and there are grooves in the top for supplies. I think I will call it a "table".\n\nTinker's Log #8:\n\nI made a few more tables with different patterns in them. They look useful for different things, so I put different materials and tools by each one. Perhaps I will come up with a use for them in time.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page5=Tinker's Log #9:\n\nTo make tools, you need to know what you're making. The pickaxe and shovel are easy enough to make with practice, the best crafters in my village told me, but I can't seem to make any good ones. Out of frustration I punched a hole in a wooden board. And another. And a few more. By the end I had something that resembled an axe, and that gave me a few ideas...
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page6=Tinker's Log #10:\n\nI punched holes in a few boards carefully in different shapes. I spent a lot of time making them, so they look really good. They all resemble the parts of tools that I can remember: heads, handles, bindings, pieces, and some others. They look really useful, so I placed them by a table for later.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page7=Tinker's Log #11:\n\nI grabbed a few of the boards and started to make tool parts using them as an outline. The parts themselves feel sturdy, and when I put them together the end result felt a lot better than Betsy did. They're made completely out of stone, something even the finest crafters could never manage. This feels like a great accomplishment.\n\nTinker's Log #12:\n\nPerhaps making a tool completely out of stone wasn't the best idea. It didn't last very long. On the upside, instead of shattering into dust only the tip scratched off. I glued a new tip on the head and it seemed good as new.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page8=Tinker's Log #13:\n\nI wanted to make a few more tools, but the boards with tool shapes in them went everywhere! I ended up breaking a few out of frustration. They don't fit very well in my chest either. I took a few of them, added a few slots to the bottom of the chest, placed it by my table and called it good. \n\nI also named them "Patterns", the chest a "Pattern Chest". I'm still angry at them, and it took so long to make new ones...
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page9=Tinker's Log #14\n\nToday I learned just how hard it was to shape iron. First you have to dig it out of the earth. A wooden pickaxe will shatter the ore; this I found out the hard way. Once you do get that ore there isn't much to do with it besides throw it in the furnace. Melting the iron and the stone seems inefficient, but I do need the metal more than I care about the waste. \n\nI shaped a few of the bars into tools, and they felt strong. Much stronger, in fact, than the ones back at the village. I've named the pickaxe "Krug" after some of the stories Nana used to tell me at night. How I miss her...
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page10=Tinker's Log #15:\n\nThis place holds little for me now. I've packed up my things, grabbed what resources I can carry, and set off. The tables and patterns will have to stay behind. I can't possibly carry them with all the food I have.\n\nTinker's Log #16:\n\nA week later and I've finally found some others to visit. Some of them seem nice, most don't look like me. A few of them have things I never could have dreamed of. They've pointed me at a patch of land that was quiet and secluded. There I should be able to work, for I have ideas from the journey.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page11=Tinker's Log #17:\n\nAfter three days and nights of fending off zombies, I've finally created a house. It has a few rooms, a basement, but most importantly a workshop. All of the tables and patterns I had before are here, as well as a few others I wanted to try out from the trip. \n\nThere's a round one I can cook food with and one that's just as good as any hoe, but can chop trees or actually dig the ground up. The villagers tell me these are named "Frying Pan" and "Mattock". The Frying Pan seems heavy enough to smack creepers with. I have a sword named "Shimmer" that I want to alter somehow.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page12=Tinker's Log #18:\n\nOne of the villagers was kind enough to give me some random things. Each one looks useful in their own right. I was lucky enough to find a few diamonds earlier, and I have a few more tools in storage. This should be fun.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page13=Tinker's Log #19:\n\nAfter some heavy experimentation, I've ended up with some things that look amazing and others that look less useful than they actually are. A diamond tip on a pickaxe makes for a wonderfully hard mining tool, and an emerald on a sword hilt somehow makes it stay together longer, but some things don't do anything. \n\nAdding flowers to a tool does nothing; they don't even stay on the thing. Mushrooms have a similar effect, and adding more material to a tool just makes it heavier. You wouldn't think redstone would do anything. I've coated a shovel so much that it looks deep red. However, it slides through dirt as if the dirt wasn't there.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page14=Moss is also a strange one. Somehow it seems to be healing the tool, even to the point where it looks like new.\n\nTinker's Log #20:\n\nI tried to make some tools out of gold, like the crafters in my village used to, but instead it broke the table. Some of the villages laughed at me for such an idea... if only they knew.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page15=Tinker's Log #21:\n\nSome of these tools are more useful than I thought. Adding blaze powder to a weapon seems to give it some kind of burning effect. Lapis has this strange quality of being able to find more materials in the same area, even if I know exactly what I'm looking at.\n\nTinker's Log #22:\n\nI have some ideas for creating tools, but for that I need a large place to create them. The furnace is inadequate, and I need a lot of stone. Combining lava with coal and netherrack seems to instantly cook stone as I mine it, up to the point where I can bypass the furnace entirely.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page16=Tinker's Log #23:\n\nToday I made something strange. It's round, wooden, and doesn't look like anything I've ever seen. Someone came by and said it was a "wheel" and that they were great fun to roll around. I wonder what else it could be used for?\n\nTinker's Log #24:\n\nI made a few more of the wheels to get some practice in. I had some fun rolling them around, rolling them in pairs, and then one ended up beside my boat. It just looked so natural I had to start putting them together.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page17=Tinker's Log #25:\n\nI think I'm on to something here. Combining the boat with the wheel made it work something like a minecart, only I can pull it around places. It feels a little small though.\n\nTinker's Log #26:\n\nI have all these tools laying around with little notes on what each one does. Instead of leaving them scattered about, I think I will create one place to store them.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page18=Tinker's Log #27:\n\nI went exploring and found some new ores today. They're colors I've never seen before, and they don't shatter on impact like iron does. I wonder what I can do with these?\n\nTinker's Log #28:\n\nThe normal furnace is nice for keeping warm, but it leaves something to be desired for processing metal. I've dug a pit and lined it with some clay, gathered lava nearby, and put ore in the center in an attempt to improve on the design. The results were quite interesting.
item.tconstruct.manual.diary.page19=The more lava I fed into the pit the hotter the material became. Eventually the whole thing liquified. I broke open the side of the pit with a cauldron in an attempt to catch the material, but it went everywhere. There were some remnants left in the pit as well.\n\nRaw ore still has parts of stone in it. There must be a way to remove the excess.

item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.title_page=Mighty Smelting\nMake the most of your metals\n\nBy Thruul M'gon
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.casting_link=Casting
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.construction_link=Construction
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.alloys_link=Alloys
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.intro1=Welcome to the world of metalcraft. Within these pages you will learn the secrets of crafting rare and precious metals into usable materials.\n\nYou will learn how to cast everything from the softest Iron to the hardest Manyullyn into whatever shape you desire and create alloy mixes from obscure materials. As always, experimentation is key!\n\nThe main structure for melting metals is called the Smeltery. It is larger than structures you may be familiar with, but the method for construction is relatively simple. It operates much like a furnace with a drain.
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.intro2=When working with the Smeltery, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n* The Smeltery functions as a large liquid tank. It is capable of melting metals and mixing various things.\n\n* Drains function as input/output for the tank. If you need to get liquids back into the structure, simply pour them into a drain.\n\n* Ores naturally have more material than processed versions, such as ingots. The Smeltery will preserve the full value of the ores - roughly twice as much as a regular furnace would provide.
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.intro3=* Mixing two or more metals in the Smeltery may result in an alloy. The process happens automatically.\n\n* If you need more space to process metal, add more layers.\n\n* Casts are made differently from Patterns. Details are found later.
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.getting_started=The Smeltery is a multi-block structure. You will need the following materials to get started.
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.smeltery_parts1=1 Smeltery Controller
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.smeltery_parts2=1 Seared Tank
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.smeltery_parts3=9 Seared Bricks
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.smeltery_parts4=Any combination of 10 Seared Bricks, Seared Tanks, or Drains
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.smeltery_parts5=1 Faucet
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.smeltery_parts6=1 Casting Table
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.construction1=Begin construction by laying a 3x3 bed of seared bricks. Leave any space above these bricks open; you will be constructing a shell around a 3x3 hollow inside. \n\nPlace the Controller one layer up and the lava tank anywhere on the same level. Fill in the rest of the space with seared bricks, lava tanks, or drains as you like. \n\nThe small end of drains should be facing the outside. If you're successful, the Controller will light up and start working. Fill the tank with lava, the Smeltery with metal, and watch it go.\n\nThe structure must be a 5x5 shell due to the amount of heat lava gives off. There are no vertical restrictions to the size of the Smeltery.
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.construction2=Larger Smelteries will hold more metal, of course, and the Controller can be on any level so long as there is a lava tank to match.\n\nWhen you are ready to pour liquid metal from the Smeltery, put a faucet on a drain and a casting table below it.\n\nOther liquid removal objects will work, but are frowned upon. An example picture is provided for your convenience.
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.figure1a=Figure 1a
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.alloys=Alloys are made when two or more metals are mixed in precise proportions. Currently known alloys are:
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.bronze=Bronze, made from Copper(3) and Tin(1)
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.brass=Brass, made from Copper(3) and Zinc(1)
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.manyullyn=Manyullyn, made from Cobalt(2) and Ardite(2)
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.alumite=Obzinite, made from Zinc(5), Steel(2), and Obsidian(2)
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.pigiron=Pig Iron, made from Iron(1), Blood(1), and Emeralds(1)
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.liquids=There exist a few liquids that are gained through strange means. Currently known liquids are:
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.blood=Blood, damaging entities in the Smeltery
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.emerald=Liquified Emeralds, melting down emeralds or villagers
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.glue=Glue, melting down horses in the Smeltery
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.slime=Slime, found on slime islands. It functions as a spawner
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.ender=Ender, either melting down ender pearls or endermen
item.tconstruct.manual.smeltery.casting1=Blank casts are made by pouring aluminum brass into an empty casting table. These are used in crafting recipes and can be re-melted.\n\nYou can also make casts out of clay but those won't last very long...\n\nPart casts must be created by pouring metal around existing parts, like a pickaxe head.\n\nAlternatively, you may craft Casting Forms out of aluminum brass blank casts and pour steel into them to create molds for use with Alloy Smelters and Fluid Solidifiers. This consumes the casting form.

item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.projectiles_link=Projectiles
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.intro1=Why walk up to hit stuff, when you can do that while standing here!\n\nA tinkerer knows how to create varied ranged weapons. There are two big categories: Thrown weapons and weapons that shoot projectiles.\n\nBoth types utilize an ammo system. Instead of having several items, these ranged weapons consist of one item that contains many of it. Why carry around 2 stacks of arrows, when you can have 200 in one stack!\nThese Ammo-Items don't have a durability, but use up their ammo for each projectile thrown/shot.
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.contents=Throwing Weapons:\n* Throwing Knife\n* Shuriken\n* Javelin\n\nProjectile Weapons:\n* Shortbow\n* Longbow\n* Crossbow\n\nProjectiles:\n* Arrows\n* Bolts
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.throwing_weapons=Throwing Weapons\n\nThrowing Knifes:\nThese knifes are crafted from a knife blade and a handle.\nHold right-click to take aim, and release it to throw a knife.\nThrowing knifes stack up to a moderate amount, and deal moderate damage.\n\nShuriken:\nSmall delicate projectiles put together from 4 parts, that are thrown from the wrist. Because of this you don't need to take aim and can throw them directly.\nSince they're so small you can carry many of them, however they don't deal much damage.
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.javelin=\n\nJavelin:\nThis is a hybrid between a melee and a ranged weapon, consisting of an arrow head on two tough tool rods. It deals moderate damage as a melee weapon, but to unleash its true potential you have to throw it at your enemy.\nThe throwing has a small windup. Because of their size you can only carry a few, but they pack a punch.
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.projectile_weapons=Projectile Weapons\n\nShortbow:\nPut together from two bow limbs and a bowstring, this weapon is a fast and handy bow. Keep in mind that inflexible materials like stone can hardly be drawn back and can't accelerate projectiles well. Organic materials are favoured for quick bows, while metals require lots of strength to draw back, but provide more power.\nThe bow requires arrows as ammo.\nOffensive modifiers on bows do not count for arrows. The only modifiers affecting its ranged performance are Redstone and lapis.
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.longbow=\n\nLongbow:\nThe big brother. This bow is much bigger, requiring more time to pull it back, but boy oh boy are those arrows fast.\nBecause of this the longbow performs slightly better against armored targets. Furthermore this makes the longbow less accurate with very light arrows.\nThe longbow is constructed from two bow limbs, a bowstring and a large plate.
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.crossbow=\n\nCrossbow:\nThose pesky metals are such a pain to pull back. Luckily a tinkerer knows how to help himself! The crossbow allows you to pre-load it with a bolt, and have it ready instantly to fire. Since this allows for much more power, it can shoot heavier projectiles, resulting in more damage and armor penetration.\nTo load a crossbow simply right-click and wait until the animation is done. The loading process can be stopped by pressing right-click while sneaking. The crossbow can be unloaded in the same way.
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.projectiles=Projectiles\nFor these projectiles goes: The heavier the projectile, the more damage carries through armor.\n\nArrows:\nThe bread and butter of every ranger. Arrows can be built from many different materials. It needs an arrow head, a shaft and a fletching.\nThe choice of materials allows a balance between damage, arrow-count, accuracy and fragility. The head material is crucial for its weight.\nA fragile arrow has a chance to break on impact with terrain. Arrows always break when they hit a target, however the reinforced trait gives a chance for the arrow to survive the impact.
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.part_materials=\n\nValid Shaft Materials:\n* Stick\n* Sugarcane\n* Bone\n* Blaze Rod\n\nValid Fletching Materials:\n* Leaves\n* Slimeleaves\n* Feathers\n* Slime
item.tconstruct.manual.weaponry.bolts=\n\nBolts:\nCrafting bolts is a delicate process. First you need a core in the form of a tool rod.\nTake this tool rod to a smeltery and put it into a Casting Table. Pour some metal onto it to coat the tip with a more damaging material.\nAfter this process, add a fletching and your bolts are ready to be used.\n\nSince the bolts consist of a harder core and tip they carry more weight than regular arrows, making them perfect to fight armored targets.
